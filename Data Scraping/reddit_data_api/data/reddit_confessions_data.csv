And it’s not because I didn’t want to attend that concert, I really wanted that, but not even one of my friend agreed, it’s not about the concert only, I am a person who lives alone and my family lives in a different town, I see people on their birthday getting tagged in shit ton of stories or post, but no one ever tags me, i didn’t even got a call from my family I had a friend who used to call it at exactly 12 but today I didn’t even get that call, I asked my office colleagues to celebrate my birthday with me and I will sponsor liquor’s and cakes and everything yet they said they had plan for weekends, i hope I am not a terrible person, I think I am but I always wished people on time, I never purposefully hurt anyone but if I did I am sorry, I never did that though, I think they did not like how I look maybe, I have vitiligo and I am not that successful for my age, because I am little under confident, is that why people hate me, I don’t know why people hate me cause if I am unsuccessful I can be successful but that’s not it, maybe they hate that I have vitiligo, maybe that’s the reason, but I didn’t ask for it, I just got it, but can people just hate me just because I have vitiligo, I think so, I wouldn’t hate anyone though, I love all kind of people even the one who literally beaten the shit out of me when I was school because I got offended cause they were making jokes on my skin condition, maybe I shouldn’t got offended at that time, and they were only having fun I could have ignored them or maybe laughed with them, that might have resulted in a good friendship maybe, they might have wished me, I think I was always the problem, that’s why not even my parents loves me as they love my brother, he’s successful, he’s abroad with his wife and a dog, they are amazing, they didn’t wish me though it’s okay it’s still not over his office hours he is 6 hrs behind so he might have forgotten and it’s Okay, he’s busy, but he was the only one who understood me, but then when he got married and he got busy and it’s understandable, hope he becomes more successful, even last year he forgot my birthday, because he had this big project he was working, my friend that always called me he didn’t call though, he said he was travelling, might be that, I think people forget me cause I am not that important, and that’s fine I don’t add anything but only takes, I think I am Terrible for not adding value in life of people maybe after that only people will call me on my birthday, but I think it’s too late now cause I think if I leave now, no one would be that hurt as they already created distance from me, and they won’t feel sad, i am a terrible person and maybe that’s why my ex called got married to someone else, she took a right decision who wants a person who will always be vulnerable infront of them, although I was strong when she told me that she’s getting married in 3 weeks, and her roka is day after tomorrow, I didn’t shed a single tear and didn’t uttered an emotional word, I just left saying congratulations enjoy your life, she might thought I am heartless, well I was heartbroken not heartless but I can understand her POV, I think you can understand why I am a terrible person, and isn’t it better to sleep forever not knowing what happened to you




Edit: I don’t know what to write now?


Just that there are literally close to 2k people that actually wanted to be my friend and wished me, I was crying last night that not even single person called or messaged and I woke up with so many wishes, my phone is heating because of all the notifications I have been getting

I woke up  and it’s 7:25 am exactly 7 hours when I started writing that post, and I think this could have been the best thing I can ask for!

I saw few comments that people want to come and attend concert with me and I would definitely love that

Everyone thank you so much in understanding, I will go through each comment and will try to reply all 200+ of you in my dm

I just can’t believe last night I was feeling extremely lonely while looking at this screen and typing this and right now there are 2000 people who are there for me rooting for me from the same screen, thank you so much Reddit for showing me that world is not that bad as I thought it was!!!!


Thank you everyone 

This is definitely some kind of miracle or a sign and I love you all for that


Edit 2: I love you all, thanks for reaching out in my inbox, and I think this is the best gift I can ever ask


Coldplay Mumbai concert was attended by 60k people and I have more upvotes than that, that means there are more people here for me than they are there in the stadium. I am really thankful to you guys! 

My post was deleted so I could not update you guys! I invited two friends to attend with me on concert and they agreed, a lot of things have been very positive with me in past few days and I thinks it’s all because of you guys! 


I am not a YouTuber but I am definitely gonna make a video on this and upload it as my first video in the next 15 days cause this needs to be out their in the world, that Reddit is just amazing and how it can actually help people!

https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/c11din/im_putting_my_extremely_profoundly_disabled_7/,1560628386.0,SpecialNeedsDevil,I'm putting my extremely profoundly disabled 7 year old into a residential facility so I can forget he exists. I'm not sorry.,"I can't tell anyone this, even my therapist. Lambast me if you wanr and maybe I even deserve it. I only ask what you would do if you were in my situation. Not what you think ""people should"" do. What you would REALLY do. 

I'm a single mom of 2 boys. 12 and 7. My husband passed away 3 years ago in a work accident. A very large portion of me believe it was a suicide. I can't see him EVER making the mistake he made that caused his death, and he had taken an action just before that which ensured his co-workers weren't in the room. I fully believe he killed himself because of our younger son and no one will ever change my mind. 

We were told when I was pregnant that he would have Downs Syndrome. We could handle that. Even if it was severe. It turned out he has a chromosome deletion. His disorder is kind of rare so I won't post which specific one but suffice to say he'll never be anything more than he is now or has ever been. 

And what he is, is nothing. 

He doesn't appear to have any awareness and never has. His eyes are locked in one position, he doesn't respond to noise, touch, or pain. He is total care. He is capable of nothing. He is tube fed and on oxygen. He is in diapers and will be forever. He makes no sounds, no attempts to communicate. He never even really cried as a baby.

He has never made an attempt to interact with anyone or his environment. 

I'm not upset because I got a special needs/""imperfect"" child. I feel the way I feel because this...... thing..... takes up 200% of my time and does NOTHING. I didn't get an imperfect child. I didn't get *a child*. 

I don't love him. He doesn't have any personality, there is nothing to love. And yet I'm responsible for him. In addition to his extreme delays he's also medically fragile. Respiratory crises, fecal impactions (his autonomic nervous system doesn't function properly), issues with his G tube, infections, pressure sores no matter WHAT we put him on or how we position him. 

Our older son has suffered because his non existent brother has colored everything in his life. He's had medical care get delayed because there's only one of me and hos brother is more critical. We do have a visiting home nurse but only 20 hrs/week and we aren't eligible for more. I was starting law school, I gave up my dreams and my plan for my children for this potato. My older son can't do a lot of things he wants to do because of the youngers need for care and appointments. 

The final straw was I heard a sound. I went into Younger Son's room to check, thinking he had forgotten how to breathe again, and saw Older Son hitting him and screaming ""You're why I don't have a mother! You're why I don't have a father! You're why I can't have friends over! You're why I can't be in sports! I didn't ask for you and I hope you die!"" 

Instead of being horrified, I watched. And Younger Son just did. not. react. No signs of pain or fear or upset. No reaction at all. 

He breathes but he is not alive. He doesn't know who I am. He doesn't know who Older Son is. He has no sense of self, life experience, or awareness of his surroundings. 

He doesn't need to be in my home. He doesn't know or care where he is. He is genetically my son but he is not family. My previously abused, brain damaged cat who can't walk straight has more personality and is far more loveable than my ""child"". In fact I was looking FORWARD to raising a Downs baby. Even one with severe impairments, for that reason. With disability can come gifts. This boy is not a gift. He is a genetic mistake I probably should have miscarried and would have definitely terminated if I'd known he would be like this. And the flip side is, if he HAS awareness..... he's miserable. And there is nothing I can do. If he has likes and dislikes no one knows what they are. If he is in pain he can't tell anyone. If he wants anything, he can't communicate. He's had every imaginable therapy, nothing has made a difference. 

And so he's leaving our home on the 29th. I feel excited and relieved and then guilty because I know we'll be happier with him gone. 

He's already taken my husband and my son's father. He was working so so so much OT to pay for the cucumber's care. For the experimental therapies insurance wouldn't cover. Because THIS one was going to be the BREAKTHROUGH. He was tired and defeated and disappointed. He sought counseling as well but I don't think he could ever say the words ""I don't want my son in my home"" either. 

He's ruined my older son. I was so wrapped up on the younger I never realized how ignored and damaged he was. He lost his father too. I didn't just lose my husband. HE is my priority now and this malignant lump can be someone else's problem. At least they'll be paid a wage to care for him. At least they'll get a break from him when they punch out. 

I just want to never think of him again and I'm not sorry. And for that, I'm sorry. 

Thanks for reading.

Edit: Thanks /u/piconeeks, for calling me a liar. Are you a medical doctor? If your Google Fu was any good you would have stumbled on 3p mosaic deletion-duplication syndrome. That is the disorder my son has. I've basically identified myself by posting that but hey, it's better than the PMs telling me to kill myself. If you look at the features of 3p deletion syndromes *they look like Downs*. My insurance didn't cover AFP testing which would have told us it WASN'T Downs and I didn't think we needed it. I had a regular ultrasound and a 3D. Both Drs were ""99% sure it was Downs"". 

This post was absolutely NOT fiction. Instead the mods and especially /u/piconeeks just ""decided"" it was. 

If anyone would like I'll doxx myself. You can see my ID to verify my name, my marriage license, and my husband's death certificate. I will then link you to the news article of the ""freak industrial accident"" that ended his life so you can see it's the same person. 

As for not choosing hospice for my son - I can't. About a year ago I myself was hospitalized with severe depression and C-PTSD (there is proof of that too). During that time my late husbands mother petitioned to get control as my son's medical proxy and got it. I'm fighting it but it's a long, complicated process. There are competency hearings. There are statements from doctors and evaluations. Unless SHE oks hospice, which she refuses, I cannot decide that. I have custody. I cannot ake medical decisions. She agreed to residential care which I feel is the second best option. So, he's going into residential care. 

As for ""mistaking"" a child choking with hitting, I was downstairs. I couldn't hear what my older son was saying. I only knew he was speaking. Go punch a blanket or, idk, a person with weak muscle tone. Then ask said person with weak muscle done to cough. They don't cough normally/forcefully. It's more a ""strong puff"". Similar to, again.... idk... a muted punch. When you're used to jumping at every strange sound, it's difficult to discern what's what sometimes. 

So, /u/piconeeks..... anything else you'd like to know? Care to admit I *just might be* telling the truth? There were identify details I left out but guess y'all need them.",65634,2796,1.0,16.0,1322,639,7154,0.08437494592677192

I actually do have other redeeming characteristics but he married me because I was hot. I know this. Everyone knows this. It doesn't feel great but I can deal with it. We've been married 20 years. 4 kids. So we are stable and we have lots in common at this point. And we do love each other. But if I could go back and slap myself I would. 

What nobody tells you- or they try and you don't listen because you're a dumbass teenager- is that marrying like this means you will fucking owe him. For everything. Every goddamn day. Not just in the bedroom but in every other matter in your life. The stuff you never imagined someone else trying to decide for you. And you don't just owe him for the money. It's a lot heavier than that. He'll never say it out loud. But you'll know the deal. Fundamentally unequal. He'll pull rank at the most random times and it will make you feel like you're falling through the floor.

Lights behind me so I pull over. I know I’ve barely got any gas at all and was almost to a gas station, hence why I rolled through the stop a little. Trying not to have the car die. 

At the time (around 1995) a new digital phone had come out called Voicesteam (now TMoblie) and their whole big thing was the phones were digital and not cellular. They were the first phones with caller ID and one of the big things the salesman had said over and over was since it was digital the signal couldn’t be triangulated or traced. Not that I cared but it stuck in my mind. 

Well as I give the cop my license, registration and insurance card I got an idea. I knew if I was late to work I was going to lose my job. They were super strict there. 

So I get an idea and right after I hand the papers to the cop and he’s walking back to his cruiser I called 911 and tell the operator I just saw a guy with what looked like a shot gun walk into a 7-11 that was about 2 blocks away. I confirmed the address then I hung up. 

About 30 seconds later the cops comes sprinting to my car and hands me all my stuff and rushed says, “come to a complete stop next time!!” Then peels off to the direction of the store. 

Pushed my car to the gas station that I’d almost made it to and felt pretty pleased with my ingenuity. 

I was an idiot and I confess!

Edit: Wow, this blew up.  I forgot to mention I would have gotten arrested, booked and released, because I was driving with a suspended license for unpaid traffic tickets and I had a bench warrant for it.  Because I’m an idiot!

So it wouldn’t have been just a few mins late to work. The job was a physical high turn over one that didn’t tolerate much.

A lot of people were asking for an update so here it is.

I wrote up a long ass apology letter that I wanted to read to my brother. I waited until he got home and got into bed for the night.

I knocked on his door and he was so fucking excited that it was me. I couldn't even get through the first few words. I started crying after saying ""I wanted to say I'm really sorry"" and just couldn't get through it.

I just got into bed with him and laid down next to him. He hugged me really tight and said ""I missed you buddy"".

I fucking lost it. I never cried that bad before. He just hugged me for a long time until I calmed down. We didn't talk much. He started crying for a bit too. It was the first time in a long time we just hugged. After half an hour I got up and gave him a kiss and he told me he was so happy. Why didn't I do this earlier, fuck.

I thought I could I try apologizing properly again tomorrow. I left him the note to read anyway.

I am feeling very hopeful right now and a lot of pressure in my heart is gone. I swear to God and on my own life I will never treat my brother so badly again.

I have been working part-time for the past year and I was saving some money so my brother and my mom could go on a trip to a place he really wanted to go to. But I think I will take my brother myself instead (when I turn 18).

I also realized that I need to have a relationship with my brother where I am not just taking care of him. It needs to be like a normal brother relationship. Like going for movies and stuff. It's going to take some time for me to fix the mess I created though. I'm just lucky my brother is amazing.

I received a lot of messages. I appreciate everyone for their input and I did read them all even if I didn't reply. Thanks everyone.




My actual post:

[Remorse]


I know this will get a lot of hate and yes I deserve it. I am not looking for any validation or forgiveness. I know I am a piece of human trash.

I just need to get this out.

I have a brother who is two years older then me. He has suffered from a condition since birth that forces him to be in a wheelchair anytime he is out of bed. He cannot use his arms that well either.

We used to have a great relationship until I turned 11 and I really started resenting the amount of attention he took from my parents. And how much stress he put them under.

I had to constantly help him, change him, feed him. I hated it.

There was a few years in his life when he so mean to my parents and it really made me resent him more.

I realize now that I had no right to judge him and I will never know how difficult life is for him.

I stopped hanging out with him and made more friends at school. I would tell my family all the fun I was having at school during dinner to make him feel bad.

I started barely talking to him or acknowledge his presence. He would get frustrated to the point of tears to get my attention.

It started escalating two years ago when I would purposely turn off the wifi and unplug the tv every time we had to leave the house so my brother could do nothing but sit in his wheelchair.

I would purposely delete his favorite saved shows on the DVR. I would make fun of his speech. Push things just out of his reach.

I would act disgusted when I had to change or bathe him. It always made him feel bad and he would apologize. I made my own brother apologize for taking a dump. What the fuck is wrong with me?

But my fucking saint of a brother never told my parents. And he never let me have it.

Three weeks ago, he was trying to talk to me non-stop and I was just ignoring him. I got annoyed and wheeled him against his wishes to the backyard and placed him under an umbrella and went back inside. I fell asleep and realized I left him out there for three hours.

When I went to bring him back inside he was in tears and wouldn't look at me. He was humiliated. 

I have always felt guilty about how I treated my brother all these years but my anger towards him overpowered it. But seeing that look on his face affected me in a way that was different from before.

I stopped all the bullying after that day. I couldn't even look him in the face I was so ashamed.

Last Sunday my brother told me he was glad I was his brother and friend. I couldn't even respond. I went to my room and cried.

I'm fucking crying again typing this all out. When did I become an evil trash human being? Fuck.

I'm 17 and he's 19 now. I know there is nothing I can do to make up for the past 6 years.

My brother will be returning with my mom from a specialist appointment tonight. I'm going to apologize to him and beg for his forgiveness tonight. I want to start being being a fucking decent brother to him again.

I am a healthy guy with no issues who chose to bully his only brother for something that wasn't even his fault. I am so ashamed of myself.",36652,2489,1.0,0.0,978,413,4860,-0.07226994173196705

Please help. I can’t live like this anymore.

Some of you are right I should probably see a therapist. I find peace and knowing that there are others that feel like me. It helps to know I’m not alone in feeling this way.

When I worked there they were in the process of phasing out denominational gift certificates. ($5, $10 & $25) 
The way is worked was if you spent more than half of the certificate they gave you the cash back. So if you ordered $5.50 worth of food and gave them one of the $10 gift cards, they gave you the $4.50 back in cash. My manager was in charge of destroying all the existing certificates as we transitioned to the more traditional credit card looking gift cards. 

So my manager said he shredded the certificates like he was supposed to, but one night when I was closing I found two boxes of the gift cards tucked deep in the dry storage room. They were FILLED with the certificates that were supposed to be shredded. So, I scooped them up, brought them out to the dumpster in trash bags and threw them away. After we closed, I came back and recovered the back, and brought the certificates home. I counted them. There were 1,000 $25, 1,000 $10, and 500 $5 certificates. None of them had expiration dates. Total haul was $40K in fast food certificates. 
My manager never said a word, he couldn't. He had reported them destroyed weeks earlier. 

Over the next three years my girlfriend and I toured every location in our state, and the next 4 states ordering food, and getting the change. We never kept track on a spreadsheet or anything, but we got good at knowing what menu items were just about half. 

After the first year, we started saving the change in a shoe box, and let it build up. 

I bought my first car for $7,800 cash from the change.
And for some reason A kiddie cone was $1.05, if you gave them a $5 cert they gave you $3.95 back. We threw away a lot of kiddie cones. 

Edit:

Holy crap this blew up.  Here are the answers to some of the FAQs

1. We could hit 10-12 stores in a day if we drove around for 5-6 hours.  Both of us would use a gift cert.  it was not that labor intensive.  


2. The only cameras in the store were at the cash registers & take out window.  


3. The manager has no clue who took them, or at least never treated my differently.  


4. Each gift certificate had a generic PLU on them.  E.i. All the $25 were PLU #756.

5.  When we stopped selling the certificates we were told to keep honoring them because they were pre paid.  They were not coupons.  

6.  One can only eat so many ice cream cones.  ",26827,1019,4.0,31.0,458,262,2420,0.05885714285714286

I haven’t talked about this to anyone (even though it’s been years) even my closest of friends, minus the ones that were there.

One nite when I was in college I was driving to get some liquor for a party my fraternity was supposed to throw the following night.

I was taking a street I was very familiar with to get back to my house.  It was dark but the street was lit with street lamps.  I remember that I looked at my radio for a second, just a second not very long at all.  But when I looked back up to the road  there was a man crossing.

I didn’t have any time to react, by the time I saw him he had already hit the good of my car and bounced off the side.  I remember screaming and hitting the brakes, and the wash of horror of what had just happened.  I’ll admit I had thought about speeding away, but I pulled over to the side and ran out of my car to check on this guy.

When I got to him his family was standing outside the restaurant he was leaving and they were all screaming and crying.  He has laying on the side of the road with blood coming out his nose and mouth. Two other men were standing with him trying to see if he was alright and calling 911.  All I could say was “I didn’t see him” I was frantic by the time it had set in what I had done.

I sat on the curb across from the family and listened to their crying in agony while we waited for the paramedics to arrive.  I sat there and sobbed while to paramedics took him away in an ambulance.  I don’t believe I’ve ever cried so hard and for so long.  The worst part about all of it and what still kills me today was that his wife came over to me while I was distraught on that curb, sat next to me, placed her hand on my shoulder and said “I was married to him for almost 50 years.  We had a good life.” Then she hugged me and said that she forgave me.


  After everything was said and done it was ruled that it was an accident.  I wasn’t charged with anything and I had one of my friends pick me up from the police station.  I went down a dark path the years after that.  I drank heavily, dropped out of college in my senior year, and had to move back in with my mother and father because I couldn’t hold on to a job.  Even tried to kill myself with pills.  It was a hard road to recovery (witch I feel I’m not fully recovered from nor do I feel I ever will be the same). But eventually I got my life back in order.  Joined up with the Navy and saw a bit of the world, and now I’m on track to go back to college and hopefully finish what I started there.   It took almost a decade but I finally start to feel almost whole again.  I’m back to hanging with my friends, and actually going out.  So maybe there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

They got back together and got married.","This was back in... let me think, maybe 1997? I was 38 and my daughter was 18, and she was dating Harry, who was 24. I was an alcoholic and dabbled in other drugs, mostly cocaine. I was not a good person, let alone mother. Not like I was abusive to my daughter or anything but I was generally inattentive and cared more about my alcohol and drugs than her, especially in her teen years. I am 14 years sober now. 

I disproved of my daughter dating harry, but I never told her why. He would flirt with me, constantly, and the age difference also creeped me out. Also, he was an alcoholic and drug user, just like me. She broke up with him over his alcoholism. 

Soon after she moved away, not too far but regardless she didn't live with me anymore. Harry kept calling me and asking if we wanted to get drinks, I turned him down, but then one day he said he had a bunch of coke and I couldn't resist. He came over, we did the coke, and we ended up having sex. He was a very good looking guy. He looked A LOT like that ridiculous 80s justin beiber picture that was on the front page today, that is actually what made me think about him. 

For the next few months, maybe like 3-4 months, he would sometimes come over and we would have sex and do drugs and get drunk together. Any drug addict knows what that is like to have a drug addict buddy in that way. 

Then I got pregnant. I knew it was by him, I had sex without a condom a few times stupidly. I never told him I was pregnant, and I went and got the abortion and kept it a secret. 

Anyways, I stopped seeing him after that, it was too weird. I also got sober, for like 4 months, before relapsing. Fast forward 2 years and my daughter contacts me and tells me that she got back with Harry, and that he is fully sober. I was mortified honestly. He was gonna tell her that we slept together, and she is going to hate me for life. They came over one day and said hi, and when my daughter was gone, Harry told me that there is no reason to tell her about what happened. I agreed. 

Its been 16 years of marriage on their part. They have a kid together. Harry got cancer, then beat it. I got sober. That's basically it. 

I don't see them very often, they live in texas and I live on the east coast. But whenever I do there is always that tension between me and Harry, its literally the first thing that comes to either of our minds, I can just tell. Not like sexual tension, like ""why did we have to do that? What the fuck is wrong with us?"" kind of tension. 

I think about this often. Especially when I see my grandson. I always think that could have been my son if things had gone differently, but WOW what a disaster that would have been if I decided to keep that child. ",24920,891,1.0,1.0,536,275,2724,0.03159708193041526

I'm writing this as a confession because I don't know where else to speak about this and I don't want my kids finding this out on my main account.

My friend died a few months back due to heart problems. He was taking care of himself so it was a shock to everyone. Especially his wife who was with him at their house when he died. Due to this she decided to move somewhere else and because she and her daughter were still distraught she asked me to pack up his stuff.

He had some boxes in his basement and after a while I started feeling nostalgic and decided to look into them. I found pictures of us from when we were kids all the way to before we got married. That was enough to make me feel bad and I just got back to taping them up. 

But one of the boxes seemed to be in much better condition, so I decided to check it in case it was something important. To my surprise I found out pictures of him and my wife from when we used to hang out together, as well as more recent pictures from family reunions. The most recent being from my wife's birthday party. 

Alongside the pictures there were letters that he never sent her. The first one dated 2 months before I met her. The last one was also the same date of her birthday party. There was one that stood out the most was one from after I started dating her. He wrote that his time had passed and since my happiness was as important as his own he would watch over us.

I'll keep his box safe since it isn't my secret to reveal.",23851,522,1.0,0.0,294,167,1494,0.10773809523809526

It was around 11 PM, and I had just gotten home from a late shift. I live in a small apartment in a not-so-great part of the city, so I’m always a little on edge when walking home. That night felt… off. As I was unlocking my door, I noticed a guy standing at the end of the hallway. He wasn’t doing anything, just standing there, but something about him made my stomach drop.

I got inside, locked the door, and tried to shake it off. Not even five minutes later, someone knocked. Hard. I froze. It wasn’t my neighbor (she texts before coming over), and I don’t really have friends who drop by unannounced.

Then, a voice - “Please, can you just let me in for a second?”

It was a woman. She sounded out of breath, almost panicked. I looked through the peephole, and there she was, maybe mid 20ish, wide eyes, glancing down the hall like she was being followed.

I know, I *know*, stupid move, but I cracked the door open just a little and asked her what is going on.

She whispered that there’s a guy, he’s been following her since she left the train. She didn’t know where else to go from there. That’s when I realized. The guy I saw earlier...

My heart was racing, but I stepped aside and let her in. I locked the door immediately, turned off the lights, and we just stood there in the dark, listening. A few seconds later, heavy footsteps passed my door. Slow. Like someone was looking for something. Then… nothing.

She stayed for about thirty minutes, just sitting on my couch, shaking. I offered her water, and we barely talked. Eventually, she called a friend to come pick her up.

When she left, she just said thank you and disappeared down the hall. I never saw her again.

My mom has 2 other sisters and a brother. My mom and aunt never got on. My mom is a lovely person but she could sense from a young age something was off about her sister, so she kept her distance. 

My Aunt was nasty and would hurt people’s feeling intentionally for no reason. She never had a partner or kids. She isolated herself from everyone. My Gran cut her off when she tried to steal thousands of dollars from her. We all genuinely think there’s something physiologically wrong with her. 

So back to where I was going with this....one morning I was at my moms house. Just chilling out and there was a knock at the door. So I opened it and there she was.

Thankfully no one seen me or I might not of been writing this right now. I got up and I left her there. I went to check my mom, she was in a lot of pain. I looked back out the window and she was gone. 

We told our family immediately about this and they were perplexed and angry as to why she just turned up and attacked my mom. I’m still so hurt and angry as I write this. But I also feel tremendously guilty and upset that I done that to her because I’ve never fought anyone and I’m not a fighter at all, but something came over me and I snapped. 

I can’t get over it for some reason. It just seemed so unreal and there was no reason for the attack. God forbid she had a weapon that’s truly scary to think about. We didn’t call the police. As I assaulted her badly and didn’t want it to bounce back on me. That’s another thing I feel ashamed about.

But should I feel bad or not? I need others opinions as I’ve been bottling this up for a while.  

My Gran was devastated, she just wanted her daughter back but from a young age she took to drugs, spent time in prison and amount of other things. You can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be saved. ",20485,1312,1.0,0.0,537,270,2707,-0.13762333762333764

I tried talking to them, telling them my boyfriend and I work at a coffee shop and bakery and our hours were really early. I bribed them with treats I made. 

They were constantly opening their windows and playing their music so loud for hours at all hours. Even their conversations were loud. With their windows open, even with mine closed I would know when their mom was visiting, when their boyfriends weren’t texting them back, or when they got their nails done. I did everything to cover it up. Music of my own, fans for white noise, tv, etc. it’s like they knew when I was actively trying and stepped up their game to be louder. Eventually we tried talking to landlords, made noise complaints, everything. They just learned how to be sneaky about being loud. Eventually it got spiteful. Putting music in the window, screaming and banging on the walls. Our houses weren’t connected but there was maybe a max of 10ft in between with a sidewalk going through. I was getting really stressed out. Losing sleep, couldn’t relax in my house, was getting sent home from work because I was so tired. It got really bad and I had no idea what to do. Nothing we had done up to this point had worked. 

When I’d explain my situation people would come up with funny revenge ideas. None of them stuck like the skunk tincture did to me. I could feel it in my bones it would work. So I ordered some on amazon and one morning as I left for work I dumped it all along the side of their house that they keep the windows open on. It smelled so bad I was worried I was gonna get some on me and I’d smell bad at work. I didn’t. 

Fast forward a couple hours and I get a notification on our camera that there’s motion. It faced in between the two houses along the sidewalk, the place I dumped the tincture. One of the girls was walking back and forth up the sidewalk spraying the rocks under the windows with Lysol. I watched it for a while and more came out. One opened the window and pulled the screen off and wiped it all down. Eventually a maintenance guy showed up. Then the gas company. I kinda started to panic at that point. I felt kinda bad, like maybe I had gone too far. I don’t think they ever figured it out or suspected me.

For the next 2 months those windows stayed shut and I barely heard anything from them. It was so peaceful. I couldn’t believe it worked. ",19871,376,323.0,1955.0,452,250,2389,-0.044629629629629596

I was 15 and my friends were 14 and 16. I was away at another friend’s house one night. When I came back the following day my mom told me she had kicked them out because the 16yo tried to make a move on my dad. She absolutely slandered that poor girl’s name. 

When I got into my 20s it still sat in the back of my mind. I just knew I didn’t get the truth. So I reached out to the 16yo who was also now in her 20s. We met up and I got the true story. I could see the pain in her eyes. She said she’d been in therapy for years because of my father. That he did it in such a loving way, it really fucked her up. She told me they’d been drinking on the property then went skinny dipping. All while my mother was in bed pregnant with my sister. They made their way into the house and upstairs. Where eventually my mother walked in on them. I let her know I had her back if she ever decided to do anything about it. 

I am now in my 30s and recently became a mother and it’s all I’ve been able to think about. They still don’t know that I know the truth. It’s reawakened the rage in me. Especially all of the teenage rage they made me shove down for so long. Because if anyone did that to my daughter, or if I caught my husband in that situation, HELLLLLLL NO. It was easy to shove down before because I learned from the best, my parents. But becoming a mother, especially to a daughter, I’ve never wanted someone to pay for something they’ve done so bad. 

I feel like if I brought it up to my mom she would just get angry and talk shit. She’d probably say the past is the past and I need to let it go. That people can change. But I know he hasn’t changed due to events over the recent years with his anger and control issues. He’s a very big narcissist who believes he can do no wrong whatsoever. And my mother is so far up his ass. It makes me wonder if the 16yo was his only victim. If she was, and if he’s never done it again, would that be okay? Is this forgivable? Because I don’t feel like it is. 

I want to tell the whole family, but I feel like they’d just downplay it and make me seem crazy. Cut me off and turn my siblings against me. They’ve done it before when I called them out on other things. So, here I am. Just needing to get it out I guess. What would you do? ",19698,1969,1.0,0.0,487,262,2387,0.0007834757834758063

I got clean at 21 years old after years of abuse. I got married at 26 to my amazing and beautiful wife. She knows I was an addict. 

I spent all these years not even really thinking that much about the concept of relapsing. It had been *so long*. I still thought about it, but with marriage and my kids and everything the thought of it was just so ridiculously out of sight to even consider trying it again. 

3 weeks ago, it was my friends birthday. He is 4 years younger than me so of course he wants to go to some cool hip sketchy bar/club thing in bushwick. 

I got drunk, really drunk. I hadn't really drank much at all in the past few years so my tolerance was way lower than expected. There was a dealer outside and a few other junkies nearby. I don't even fully remember what happened, I just remember going with them, abandoning my friend at the bar (it was like 1am anyways), and going to some apartment and shooting up. I spent the night there, then all the way until noon the next day. I had 10 missed calls. 

I panicked when I came out of my daze. I told my wife I had gotten way too drunk and was puking and my phone was out of battery so I stayed at Charlies house. She was disappointed I didn't tell her but also thought it was funny because she used to tease me for not being able to handle my liquor. This was a ""I told you so"" moment, she had told me not to drink too much before I went to the bar. She wasn't even in new york, she was at a summer house with the kids in Massachusetts. 

I spent the next 4 days until they got back just... riddled with anxiety, urges to get more heroin, horrific mind zaps (I dont even know what to call them). It was, in some ways, worse than my withdrawal symptoms when I first was an addict. Not because of the physical feeling, but the horrible mental feeling of what I was possibly giving up, my wife and kids. I wanted to fucking get more so badly. I left my house to find heroin 4 fucking times. 4 times, I gave up to get more, but wasn't able to find any and snapped back to reality and went back home. I still thank FUCKING GOD I did not somehow run into some street dealer during those 4 times. I would have absolutely done it. 

I feel like everything I thought about myself, that I was strong, that my addiction was behind me, that I had beat heroin... it was all gone. I am not going to say I am back at square one or anything, I am not. But I feel like something inside of me has reset. My unwavering strength against addiction was broken at the slightest temptation. I still am weak. Heroin is so, so much stronger than me. Its truly unbelievable how much stronger it is than me. 

When I was young, my aunt had cancer. She beat it. Then it came back soon after, and she beat it again. It didn't come back, and we loved how strong she was for fighting her cancer and that she had overcome it. She lived with us. I remember her feeling of strength after her 2nd year of not having cancer, her 3rd year, her 6th year.... it finally felt like it was gone for good. Her thinking ""its finally behind me now, its a part of my past"", and then it just fucking came back. 9 years after her first diagnosis, it came back and killed her. I remember her feelings and how she felt about it. So many years after she thought it had gone away. 

That is how I feel. Like a cancer which I thought I got rid of a decade ago just showed back up on my screening. 

The first 5-6 days after I tried it that time outside the bar were the worst. My kids and wife have come back. The urges mostly went away the second I saw my kids. I hugged them so damn hard. 

And I never told my family what happened, nor will I ever. My wife never understood that side of me, she met me 5 whole years after I was clean. I just cannot have her know, ever. 

I won't do it again. I am planning on not drinking to excess like that again, except maybe in very specific situations like at the summer house where there is no option of drugs. I mean, not like I WANT to get drunk again like that, but just in case I ever want to get loose? I am never doing that in the city again. 

I am still about 90%+ sure that I won't ever touch heroin again. I am still positive in myself about it. Its just... it used to be 99% sure. That is what fucking terrifies me. 

I said heroin is stronger than me. It is absolutely stronger than me. But the reason I won't ever do it again is that it isn't stronger than my family, my wife and kids. I don't care about how good it feels, I will not subject my wife and children to me being an addict. I would rather just kill myself than that. ",17887,841,1.0,0.0,930,406,4683,0.0033590567681476818

We remembered a demonstration from a high school science class of a ""Solar Balloon"". This was just a really thin black plastic bag you'd fill with air, seal, and then set out in the sun. The sun would heat the air in the black bag and the bag would become buoyant and float.  
  
We had the idea to find the cheapest/thinnest black plastic trash bags available and combine a bunch of them to make a huge balloon. We spent a few days driving around to Walmarts and dollar stores trying different brands to find the thinnest possible plastic bag and thinnest tape which would work the best. Finally we took a number of them, cut off the bottom ends, and taped them together into a huge balloon which we filled up with a leaf blower and then tied the end. After sitting out in the sun for a half hour or so we had done it!  
  
[This is a picture a friend had taken as it was just becoming buoyant.](https://imgur.com/1kMEbpm)
  
We had to mess around with how the tape was sealing the bags to use as little of it as possible as the weight of the tape added up and made the balloon harder to float.
   
[Shortly after this the balloon got away from us](https://imgur.com/eJipKfQ)  
[Further](https://imgur.com/a/rUOxWCh)  
  
This was dissapointing, but we made another one and got funny looks from cars driving by and were entertained for a bit. Shortly after that this new balloon met it's demise smacking into a tree and getting popped. Oh well, mission success.  
  
A few years later [I happened across this news article](https://www.nj.com/news/local/index.ssf/2010/05/look_up_in_the_sky_its_a_large.html). The balloon that got away had apparently blown a town over and caused a big UFO panic. People were calling 911, the police, and local radio stations about it. Our boredom unintentionally created a UFO panic in central NJ. I moved out of the area but when I get together with my friend we always bring this up and have a good laugh.

To gain more freedom I worked hard to start my career as a 3D artist, and I was making a couple hundred every few weeks at best during most of high school.

Even with how little I made compared to how hard I worked; my mom and stepdad would pressure me to chip in for the groceries and mortgage payments. Keep in mind, we aren't poor or anything, we were middle class, and they just wanted more financial freedom for themselves so they can consistently go on luxury vacations.

I also have a few siblings (now in the higher years of high school) who they also do the bare minimum for, not bad enough to where it's child neglect but definitely not great parenting considering none of us could focus on our studies while having to work.

The creative industry is difficult and unforgiving, and I put blood sweat and tears into my work to get where I am at this age. I'm not going to let them pressure me into making any big contributions to their finances so that they can keep going on excessive vacationing sprees.

Only me and my girlfriend know how much I really make. I have been saving tens of thousands of dollars without anyone else around me knowing. One day they'll find out how much I have, but for now I will bide my time and take advantage of as little financial burden as possible. Once they do, I'll simply move out and be done with them.

The CEO was one of the biggest assholes I've ever met. He was fairly young in his 40s, a multi millionare, and the type of guy driven solely by money with 0 business ethics. He'd do anything to get the upper hand in a deal regardless of who it screws over...contractors, employees...I even saw him seriously fuck over a long time family friend of his without any remorse.

Anyway, aside from my analyst role, as it was a really small business (only about 20 people in the office, and then a bunch of people working remote), I also happened to be one of the only semi technology-literate people in the company. So like many of my generation, I became the defacto ""Millenial Office Computer Guy"" too. Despite my lack of qualifications I got put in charge of handling pretty much anything minor tech related. Setting up servers....fixing laptop issues...answering ""How do I convert this to PDF"" questions...even basic network security. They thought I was some sort of computer genius...but really I was just mostly winging it, Googling pretty much everything.

But eventually I got legitimately pretty good at all the tech stuff. They gave me bigger tasks like planning all of the computer systems for their owned businesses, and supervising installs. I didn't get paid extra for any of this mind you.

After a couple years of serious bullshit working there, I was pretty worn out. I wasn't progressing. I hated working for captain douchebag...he treated everyone like shit. I was pulling 12-14+ hour days with no overtime or performance bonus. And they weren't paying me nearly what they should have. I also hated being ""the tech guy"" and was depressed as fuck basically living in a cubicle. So I decided I full on had enough of the 9-8 life working for assholes....and I would start my own consulting business working for myself.

However, instead of quitting right away, I figured it would be smart to first build up my client base on the side while I was still getting a steady paycheck. So thats what I did. I launched my company, and landed my first clients.

As the workload increased, I slowly started spending more and more time working on my side business while at my office job. At first I was pretty low key about it. But eventually, it was blatant. As it was a super small company....I was the only one who knew how to do a lot of important tasks and operate some key internal systems. It was easy for me to tell my boss a project was taking a whole week to complete, that I actually finished in 10 minutes.

Pretty soon I was spending 80% of my day working on my own stuff in the office. I'd even take calls for my side business clients at my desk. The rest of the time I was usually dicking around on Reddit or something. Of course, we had systems in place to monitor network activity. But I was the person in charge of monitoring it.

This continued for a while. As my own business ramped up, I cared less and less about the office job. And since I hated waking up early, I began rolling into work late. At first it was only 30 minutes or so. Then it progressed to an hour. When my boss didn't reprimand me...it became clear how much they needed me there. I took full advantage of this. Before long I was arriving around Noon, working for a couple hours, then heading home. 

My coworkers werent happy, but I helped them with all of their tech problems and they hated the company too, so they kept their mouths shut about it. My boss eventually said something to me about all it at one point, but I just came in on time the next few days and then went back to coming in whenever I wanted.

After more than 2 months of coming in 4-5 hours late, and working on my side business in full view of my asshole boss, I couldn't believe I wasn't fired yet. I deserved it and felt it was inevitable.

On a hunch, I decided to do a little investigative work. As I was the ""tech guy"", I also had full access to the company email server. So I logged into the CEO's personal email account, and searched for my name. Lo and behold, there was a recent email thread between him, my direct boss, and some other team members with my name in the subject line. Obviously I open it. They're discussing my recent performance issues...the last email in the chain basically said ""If nobody has any objections, I will be terminating him at the end of the week"". 2 days from then.

I wasn't surprised, but I decided there was no way I was going to let these assholes fire me. Although I didn't give a shit about that job, I didn't want to have a termination in my work history. I also wanted to keep getting paid for a while longer. Of course, I couldn't let him know I actually knew I was getting canned. So, I formulated a plan to perform a little inception reverse-psychology mind fuck on the CEO.

The next day, one day before they planned to fire me, I requested a meeting with him to ""discuss my current performance."". In that meeting I sat down, and he asked me what I wanted to talk about. So I told him (paraphrased): ""Look, I know I've been a shitty employee lately. I'm sure you've noticed. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've been kind of getting the feeling you guys are planning to let me go soon."" When I said that the shocked look on his face was priceless...he must have thought I was psychic to work that out on my own the day before it was going to happen. I remember him just saying something like “uhh"". I continued while he sat flabbergasted. ""So I'll be honest with you, My heart isn't in this job anymore. As you know, I'm an entrepreneur at heart...which I’m sure you can relate to. I want to start my own company. However, as you're aware, I have a lot of responsibilities here nobody else can do."" I then proceeded to list all of the things I did and projects I was working on. I could see it on his face when the realization sunk in of how screwed he'd be if I left suddenly.

""So here's what I propose. You don't fire me. I don't quit. I keep working here for a month, finish my current projects, and train whoever you want on everything I'm in charge of. After a month is up, I will continue to come in once per week until its complete. After that, if you still need me...you can pay me on an hourly project-by-project basis"".   

I intentionally mentioned the possibility of me quitting so he could feel like he ""won"" the negotiation, even though I technically had him by the balls. 

He paused to think for a minute, then said something along the lines of: ""Okay. You have a deal"".  

So, not only did I get myself unfired...I actually turned the company into a paying client. During that month, I continued doing pretty much whatever I wanted since I had an expiration date (while training my replacement as promised). After the month was up they hit me up regularly for remote task work . I charged them triple what I was earning while working there, and barely had to deal with the CEO.  my client base was big enough I dropped them for good.

...after all that, the CEO still calls me up for advice/questions nearly 3 years later. These days I just blow him off saying ""Sorry, I'm too busy"".

**Edit:** As it seems there’s some doubt that this actually happened (it did), figured I’d clarify a few points.

1) This was a very small company. The office had about 20 people in it, and several dozen more worked remote. If you’ve never worked in a small office before, I can assure you it’s pretty normal for employees to wear many hats and take on random roles outside their initial scope. It’s also pretty normal for them to be severely lacking with network security and controlling passwords. 

2) I did not become some “computer genius” and never claimed to be (tho my company of technology illiterate baby boomers sometimes thought of me that way). I had decent basic working knowledge coming into the job, and picked up more over the several years I was there. For anything complicated (like wiring, hardware installs, advanced networking tasks etc) we hired outside IT consultants. But I was the guy who would source them, hire them, supervise them and learn the systems they put in place. And I just handled more basic tasks myself . We’re also not talking about enterprise level security here either

3) my consulting business has nothing to do with private equity. Im not going to reveal exactly what I do for privacy sake since this blew up, but it’s in marketing. I didn’t steal any of my old company’s clients when I left and don’t compete with them**

4) yes, Im fully aware and admit I was an asshole, hence posting this in /r/confession. In fact I decided to start my own company because I hate working for other people without my own skin in the game. I’m not a great employee when I don’t care about what I’m doing. However, the guys running the company were pretty shitty people, and I did not feel that bad about it at the time. 
  
      The thing I did have reservations about was snooping on the emails. I do not condoned invading privacy like that. However, he’d freely given me the passwords (so I could help him set up his outlook, forwarding, etc), and I felt me getting fired was inevitably coming soon.

I had been really dizzy and having a lot of headaches and I was fairly sure I needed glasses, but my mom wouldn't listen or take me to the eye doctor for some reason? I had broken my right wrist already so I knew what it felt like, and I knew if I was more severely injured they'd be forced to address the situation.

I knew I needed to do it at school when there were cameras and witnesses and no one could accuse my parents of anything sinister, so I waited for a day when I knew one of my teachers would let me leave mid-class to go to a different floor. 

I threw myself up the stairs, tore a bunch of cartilage in my elbow, shattered my growth plate in my wrist, and got an eye doctor appointment! I was already an injury prone kid (ADHD spacial awareness for the win, this did not get massively better unfortunately lmao), so no one questioned it.

I hated my glasses (think aggressively unsexy librarian) but I needed them and as much as I regret the lengths I went to, I'm glad I got them finally.

I kept noticing this girl would cheat off me and get the exact same score as me on every quiz or test. 

So I came up with a plan to make her fail a test. 

I purposely chose wrong  answers on a multiple choice test, making sure she could see what I put. 

I put a small dot on the answer I actually thought were correct. 

I then acted like I was done and waited for her to go turn her test in. 

I quickly erased all my answers and changed to the ones I had dotted earlier. 

She had came back to our table and I could tell she was horrified when she saw me doing what I was doing.

Long story short, she ended up failing the test and I got like an 80 something on it. 

I sort of rubbed it in too because I made sure to ask her how she did. 

I’ve only told a few people this story. 

One person told me it was kinda psychopathic so I felt kinda bad. 

But I just thought I was teaching a lesson or whatever I guess. 

I’m pretty sure it worked at least a little, cause she stopped cheating off me. ",16596,407,33.0,699.0,214,138,1046,-0.016098484848484838
