191614865,76561198176756298,User,5,17824,Recommended,"At first i thought this game is full of crap because it won the GOTY 2023 i look the game up its a weird turn based game with DD mechanic that i never heard It look so boring af very boring i look up the review the video gameplay its so idk boring af but then im curious whats so good about this game so i decided to buy this game for myself during Christmas Sales 

Once i played the game i was sooooooo into it and it change my mind of how good this game really is to the point i uninstall all my games just to free some space to download and play this game Game so addictive for some reason i played alot of single player games include gacha games most of em just so easily burnt out for example i bought Far Cry 4 and only have 81 minutes forgor to refund but its just there never be played ever again cause how boring it is

But this game is so good enough to the point i ignore all my friends just to enjoy the full immersive RPG goofy ahh games is a game that i really craving for so long after Cyberpunk 2077disappointed on the first day and game expensive af  Making my own decision go with my own style and flow of the game and have the opportunity to be the good and bad guy at the same time 

In conclusion by far the best game ive ever played for so long after Fallout 4 GTA 5 and RD2 Good Story Good Character Plenty of choices that cyberpunk 20777 cant achieve recommend all single player rpg gamers out there should try this game as well even though it looks boring and goofy and DD mechanic sounds stupid but it change my mind in instant as soon i played it

So step into the world of Dungeons and Dragons after an hour or two you wont want to leave I only recommend that anyone who plays this game does so with an Xbox controller The controller UI and binds for this game are as intuitive as the game is complex So what was my only gripe with this game the clunky top down controls was completely remedied by the excellent controller support",0.523809552192687988,2,False,Recent,1739172688

Dear reader going into Baldurs Gate 3 I did not expect this battle between titans to change How pleasantly surprised I was to find a game clearly cared for by EVERYONE on the end credits Whether it is making me laugh out loud rage in anger at the villains or tear up thanks to powerful character arcs this game had me hooked like NO OTHER GAME 

I still cannot wrap my head around how complex and interwoven the storyline is and how it changes with your choices Some critics may say the changes are not super significant Well maybe not on the surface but countless times my decisions in the past have echoed their way to the present and I can be damned or blessed by my actions But it doesnt stop the game from progressing It is a wild thing to try to describe Sometimes you get a gut punch from life and you really realize how important your friends and family are That is this game I have not played a game that has felt this human ever before 

It took me an insane amount of hours to beat this game I was THOROUGH My playtime here is not entirely accurate It may have taken me 200 hours to beat this game I did every possible quest that I could completed every companion arc discovered every area I could find and yes I was a save scum POS lol You can really play this game ANY WAY YOU WANT The game will be YOUR experience Similar to Deus Ex this game encourages you to think outside the box and seems positively RIDDLED with secrets some of which may yet still lay undiscovered

176806234,76561198111039865,User,13,9250,Recommended,"I bought Baldurs Gate 3 like many others caught up in the wave of hype surrounding its release At first it didnt grab me 
With no prior experience playing Dungeons  Dragons and not being a fan of turnbased combat I struggled to connect with the game The mechanics felt foreign and I found myself drifting away to play other titles

But something about Baldurs Gate 3 kept pulling me back I gave it another shot and then it clicked 
I started to enjoy the combat figuring out how to use the environment to my advantage and I realized just how much influence you can wield outside of battle Conversations choices and strategies became just as important as swinging a sword or casting a spell

I became invested in the characters more than I have in any other game Well most of them  I dont like Wyll His story just felt underwhelming compared to the others Each companion had depth and complexity that kept me hooked The freedom the game offers is truly unparalleled I could shape my own story in ways that felt meaningful I found myself losing track of time wanting to know what would happen next

Fast forward 150 hours and Ive just finished my first playthrough Without a doubt this is the best game Ive ever played and Ive played a LOT of games The sense of emptiness it leaves behind is almost painful All I want to do is dive back in and start a new run Taking suggestions on what character or class to try next

In summary yes I wholeheartedly recommend Baldurs Gate 3 Its an unforgettable experience that sets a new standard for storytelling and player agency in games

PS Be warned though after playing Baldurs Gate 3 other games may feel linear and their characters shallow in comparison",0.952427268028259277,412,True,Beta Release,1728632060
171358465,76561198051897145,Curator,9,5198,Not Recommended,"I want to like it but there is just something or several somethings that really keeps me from enjoying it

First I am not a big fan of 5e as a CRPG Its too simple for a deep crunch It always leaves me wanting more crunch to bite into or leaves me wanting it to go a ton faster I think some of Larians changes to the game help it but it still leaves me just wanting more and not in a good way I dont get excited about leveling up because of the lack of choices many classes have 

Second The companions I think when I got to act 3 I basically enjoyed 2 of them When I first played this in EA everyone was saying oh this is only half of the companions we will get this is all the evil ones they will have a bunch of other ones added in the end etc and in the end that was kinda a lie Basically outside of the main 5 the rest that are there feel even more flat and not fleshed out than the main 5 And I can barely stand the main 5 One of the biggest things I enjoyed about DOS2 and other CRPGS is the companions they add life to the game These companions suck away the life from the game for me 

Three Act 3 Yea this felt like a huge letdown When I first got to around the time the game came out it was unplayable on my comp Now its better but still kinda a huge letdown It feels so unfinished Its the same thing with DOS2 the game is so frontloaded and goes out on what feels like a whimper The big bads of the area feel like they barely thought them out and I was just left dissapointed

Four The vibes I dunno how to describe this but the game is very nouveau dnd Its kinda goofy non serious while still trying to be serious It has the same vibes I got while playing a bunch of dnd5e games kinda goofy superhero character driven while not really caring about the world story etc Its just really hard to describe how I feel but the vibes are just something I never clicked with

I feel like there is more like how some choices end up being nonchoices and not mattering spoiler illithid powers use spoiler and just other random things that kinda just picked at me


I dunno overall I really did want to like it but typically I would go back to a crpg to play a second or third time I love playing games but this games just really makes me not want to play it again I just get bored and uninspired while playing it which I feel like isnt a good thing",0.548510074615478516,59,False,Early Access,1722694544

h3The customizationh3
The game offers a wide selection for customization allowing you to choose your race background and class with the option to multiclass You can even customize your voice body type and your wiener Dialogues are influenced by your origin race and class Wizards and sorcerers can make fun of each other drows can intimidate others and companions might banter with you about whose god is the better one

If you dont want to create your own character you can play as one of the 7 Origin characters I recommend creating your own character or trying The Dark Urge He is unique as he is the only Origin character who doesnt appear in the story offering a unique playthrough you wont experience on a normal playthrough

The animations and facial expressions are impressive as well they bring life to both human and nonhuman races Even characters like dragonborns have expressive facial expressions

h3Companionsh3
The game features a huge cast of companions 10 each with their own distinct personalities and backstories Over time these companions evolve from strangers in your party to allies friends or romantic interests Companions dynamically react to your choices and to each other leading to surprising dialogues and conflicts Bringing specific companions to encounters can change how they unfold and you can influence their fatehelping them stay on their path or stray away from it The voice acting is also phenomenal Romances also features options for polymorphic or samesex relationships so no one missies out on Shadowheart or Halsin

Spoiler Alert If you dont want to miss an easily missable companionspoilerWhen you meet a drow named Minthara and if you get into a fight switch to nonlethal combat and knock her out instead of killing herspoiler

h3Open World and Explorationh3
The game does an amazing job with its story covering a wide range of topics with its central themes being trauma trust and personal growth There are three acts each offering many beautiful and memorable locations to explore Its openworld design lets you roam freely and NPCs dynamically react to your actions 

The world feels alive with consequences for your actions After 200 hours Im still finding hidden dialogues and secret details that surprise me making me appreciate the developers attention to detail

h3Gameplay and Mechanicsh3
The game offers many difficulty options from Explorer for those who just want to enjoy the story to Tactician for the minmaxers You can also play the game solo or in coop giving you the opportunity to experience the story with your friends

Combat is highly creative with spells and abilities that interact with the environment For example you can set up explosive barrels before an ambush or use water to create electrified surfaces Players can tackle obstacles in numerous wayscombat stealth magic or conversation This variety ensures you can tailor the story to your own playstyle

h3Flawsh3 
list
As with many openworld games bugs can arise due to its complex and detailed structure For example after killing a character NPCs might still refer to them as alive In one instance I exposed a thief disguised as a guard only to have him arrest me for stealing 
The nonlethal combat system while great for roleplay purposes doesnt change much regarding the story Knockedout characters are treated as dead in most cases with only a few exceptions
Lastly the game struggles to provide a meaningful evil playthrough While you can roleplay as morally grey or chaotic the evil with purpose path is underdeveloped Choosing the evil route frequently locks you out of story content companions and loot making it less rewarding compared to good or morally ambiguous paths
list

h3Moddingh3
The game supports modding through its official tools You can download mods for qualityoflife improvements like new hairstyles or face shapes to more substantial additions such as new classes or playable races For those who enjoy customizing further mods like the handsome Laezel option let you adjust her appearance though Baezel is already pretty stunning as she is

162529076,76561198154981104,Curator,13,11810,Not Recommended,"The first two acts make you want to play the game forever but the third act makes you never want to touch the game again
Genuinely I love this game and I didnt believe the others that said Act 3 is a ilarge problemi It is I get it now I also want to fight whoever is personally responsible for rushing this game
It is iso so goodi but unfortunately there are glitches that are genuinely game breaking as in you physically cannot play the game when it happens That and instructions and quest lines in Act 3 are unclear at best and nonexistent at worst

Once the issues that istop you from playing the game entirelyi are fixed Id be happy to change my review Unfortunately there are some that are even showing up as early as Act 2 Heres a little list of things I have run into that granted iI do see them trying to patchi but are unfortunately still issues as of this review

bGetting stuck in dialoguesb Either you enter the dialogue and no options pop up or you are counted as in dialogue and nothing else happens You are simply stranded immovable and inactive until a team mate can either pull you far enough away to end the convo or worse yet has to kill you to avoid having to load a save that was a whole half hour ago
bGetting stuck at 100 loadsb I am unsure why this happens but sometimes loading a save will cause the game to load to completion and then never actually put you in the game This one is extra annoying because the entire party will have to AltF4 the game or use Task Manager to kill it because even if the host kills it the other players are still stuck
bBugging out when trying to assign characters to the correct playersb I am unsure why this happens but sometimes when swapping characters between people they will both lose the ability to use either character entirely as well as any summons attached to them Usually the host will have to reboot the save and pray the above issue doesnt happen

There are also some things that dont stop you from playing the game but can badly hinder the experience

bFights and encounters during long restsb If the host starts a long rest before all players have successfully joined they cannot enter the game until the long rest is completed This also forces them to miss any encounters that happen during that time You wouldnt think this would be so bad as most of the encounters during rests are minor and unimportant iButb There are a few very very important ones namely with your dream visitor Spoilers ahead on that spoilerWe had this happen on the encounter with The Emperor when he reveals his true identity The entire fight the reveal and the option to become half Illithid were all missed by myself and I happen to be the one romancing him and gunning to become an Illithidspoiler Personally I think if there is any combat going on during a long rest that players should be able to join there not just for what I just mentioned but also because the host likely does not want to deal with the entire encounter with their team mates characters that they do not know how to play

bLack of clarity on what you are supposed to dob I am looking particularly at Act 3 for this one Im not expecting it to hold your hand but some clarity would be nice The quests in that act like to tell you some vague thing you need to go get done and then not give you a place to start Worse yet sometimes it will point it out for you on the map in completely the wrong location if it gives you a location at all I never had to use that function until act 3 and a good couple quests give you a location that is nowhere near where the actual place you need to go is at Other times they give you the name of a location and then refuse to give you any guidance as to where the heck that is In particular spoilerthe Murder Mystery quest to locate Orinspoiler really likes to tell you to go do things and give you no good direction to start looking and infuriatingly is non optional spoilerif you want to kill her firstspoiler If you want to go the other route spoiler the quest marker for Gortash actually points you to the passage downstairs instead of upstairs where he actually isspoiler All of this is fine and dandy if you are playing the whole thing in one go If you are playing it in short spurts you will likely forget a lot of things and wind up on a goose chase It really doesnt come off fun or clever to me at all just infuriatingly annoying

h1 Summary h1

I dont play story games for very long if its 8 hours long I will play it for 8 hours even if its a genuinely amazing game there is no way to reexperience my first interaction with a title I love any reruns would just dilute my memory of it

That said this is different This isnt just a story game this is a narrative masterpiece mechanically almost perfect and the single longest amount of time Ive ever spent on a game of this nature I struggle to keep hooked on high fantasy but this game exceeded every single expectation I had from the genre

In short the game is a turnbased RPG with dense player interaction dialogue story and an absolute treasure chest when it comes to variety the combat is practically a sandbox only limited by your creativity when it comes to turning goblins and human alike into a puddle where their torso used to be
Youre immediately given a fairly substantial task upon first loading in and its your goal to progress through the story with the aim of resolving it 
However the steps you take along your path to resolving it entirely shifts the dynamic of whole regions and thus how people treat you as you progress through the story Eventually the major task you have becomes a footnote as youre thrown kneedeep into something much larger than you ever anticipated 
Of course how it actually DOES resolve whether for the betterment of everyone youve met along the way or to achieve absolute power is entirely up to you but you might often find yourself making choices with a special party member in mind 

Oh and the COOP is absolutely unreal it from experience with a good host works absolutely perfectly and Ive essentially completed the entire story 3 times with entirely different groups of people each time yielding its own absolutely chaotic outcome It does seriously impact how you interact with companions though as there are a limited number of party slots so dont take your COOP playthrough as your sole experience of the game

h1 Characters h1

Phenomenal writing its very easy to dismiss the companions you find along the way as being relatively abrasive or otherwise uninteresting but as you progress through the story they begin to open up to you as your relationship dictated by your actions through dialogue interactions with the world or quest outcomes grows and thus you gain major introspective with the character 
Every companion has their own quirk something that they personally want to resolve by the end of the game If you choose to ignore them they may never achieve that without your help and potentially abandon you or worse 
They all react differently to how you roleplay your character some despising signs of empathy while others seriously admiring it it creates a situation where the dynamic of your party isnt always relying on you picking the morally good answers to get a desirable outcome ahem Starfield  
Some companions even outright love evil acts and will encourage you to do them oh and of course theres romance so thats always a win if you want to romance someone with the bloodlust of a bag of angry hornets

Additionally the nonessential or nonplayable characters you find beyond your own party are all intricate in their own right Some are a little sparser contentwise than others but everyone typically always has something to say often in regards to events youve caused or partaken in Even if you dont cross their paths early on they often show up with unique dialogue later often remarking about how your actions led them to where they are
Something I especially enjoy is that often youll keep seeing characters you save or aid throughout the entire length of the game gradually finding new ways to give aid back or just give you a little insight to story each time you find them
A very notable example without sharing too much detail is saving a character in something I originally thought was a throwaway gag where if you choose to or accidentally kill them just by pushing the wrong button it not only locks off a major outcome of a literal endgame quest but makes another entire questline marginally harder Your choices DO matter even if it isnt immediately obvious

Finally the bad guys in this game are probably my favourite in all of high fantasy media and while there is an implied major boss that youre seeking out theres a multitude of equally plot essential bosses you find with their own backstories and beyond that even the nonessential bosses are all very fun to fight all with their own gimmicks which invite you to switch up your playstyle

Plus J K Simmons the voice of Cave Johnson OmniMan Stanford Pines the yellow MM for some reason and basically hundreds of other characters youll recognise voices my single favourite boss in the whole game

Dense utterly dense packed with scenarios people to meet people to kill people to revive for reasons of questioning them about who killed them 
Quite frankly 500 hours of content is barely scratching the surface Im doing a brand new run as of right now and still discovering things Ive never seen before 
There is a deep level of worldbuilding both direct and indirect physical and implied entire regions are impacted by actions delivered long before you even arrived some are more dangerous than others for explicit plot reasons Theres little stories and quests to be found in the most obscure of places each with differing outcomes

I dont think I could ever do the story justice in this section so I wont further elaborate experience it yourself

h1 Gameplay h1

Really not what I expected when I first got into the game I was a little sceptical because I dont much care of the RPG formula of having all your actions as little buttons at the bottom of your screen I especially didnt think I would much care for a topdown turnbased point and click style experience

However I am genuinely captivated it isnt just a combat system its a sandbox Every class drastically changes how you approach issues from getting the perfect position to fireball as a squishy wizardssorcerers so you dont die first turn to just paladin charging face first at any inconvenience and it hitting it with a 7ft sword in the name of your oath for vengeance 
If youre not satisfied with just playing a singular class you can then subclass and create absolutely insane builds my personal favourite being throwzerker a barbarian that can practically instakill most targets by across map throwing OTHER ENEMIES at the targeted enemy
Alternatively you could just ignore the class system and be a barrelmancer using explosives of various types to essentially ignite entire battlefields and inconvenience your whole party
Theres legitimately no end to it If you want to play the game a certain way you probably can its absolutely DnD in nature

The fights can be quite hard at times but only if youre unprepared or have a poor party dynamic Sometimes just finding the right gear can shift a whole fight in your favour even potions I found are incredibly important as some of them can essentially triple your melee damage or let you heal after every kill The game WANTS you to experiment go nuts

h1uLegendary Masterpieceuh1
Just no other way of saying it Larian Studios took their time and crafted perhaps one of the most memorable games I had the pleasure playing in It is incredible on so many levels I actually have a hard time believing it even exits Now theres definitely some flaws with it not a true perfect game but its as close as you can imagine

h1uGameplayuh1
It really plays out like youre in a DND 5e tabletop but beyond what most would had expected It didnt just make an adaption or inspiration its a love letter to DND 5e and im here for it Gameplay is very smooth feels great with mouse and keyboard plus so much to do both in and outside combat Sure the turn based combat is the main sell but its also got a lot more going for it and those who love roleplaying and exploring while engaging with puzzles npcs and finding secrets its all here Its probably the most well designed tabletop game in the market

h1uGraphics and Storyuh1
Game is breathtaking and looks like a beautiful panting where ever you go All locations and settings in this world is brimming with life and I love how the characters are designed too So much effort went into how the game looks and its marvelous to behold seeing for yourself

The writing is straight up fire Every quest every arc in Acts 1 2 and 3 were just immersive to delve into Never did I get tired or bored of any quests no matter how small The main story is also incredibly well crafted and I bet many DMs Dungeon Masters will take much inspiration from this game Such a fantastic journey where you want to do everything the game offers going out of your way to learn more about the world what you can learn from it and completing quests just to hear more about this place Baldurs Gate 3 resides in

Your choices VERY much matter here There is no illusion or just going with the ride everything you do has either a small significant or major impact on the story No choice ever feels like it didnt matter and even story bits can change depending on what you do first like a DM adapting to how you play and NPCs can change entirely based on how successful good or horrible you are

h1uCharactersuh1
Never had I imagined any game topping the Mass Effect Trilogy in terms of developed characters But wow this is very much the only time in recent memory if ever that I loved all the characters The voice acting is just peak performance the traits and personalities of each character is so developed and they really feel like people You always experience something new with an NPC in this game no matter what playthrough theres dialogue or something you find out about them that makes you love them more Every opportunity I wanted to engage and talk to my companions completing quests with them and tangle in both friendships and relationships Not a single NPC was poorly written not one What a huge feat Larian Studios did here this is so hard to pull off but they nailed it Some companions legit made me cry irl just cause of how extremely touching or tragic segments were that left me thinking about it in my sleep

What makes these characters even more amazing is unlike Mass Effect they legit can leave you hate you or even want to fight  murder you depending on your choices They dont just tag along they have thoughts views morals and goals They do react to almost everything you do and will have actual things to say which does have impact on how the journey goes This aspect is what makes them so memorable to begin with

h1uFreedomsuh1
So one of the strongest pros of this game besides the unbelievably well written characters is how much you can do outside the box The game doesnt force you to play by the usual rules you can get really creative in and out of combat The game literally lets you cheese to your hearts content or do things even the game didnt expect you to do but youre able to With how the game is designed any object can be used in numerous ways you can do so many challenge runs with what you have at your disposal and I keep seeing people on other sites and Youtube show off just how insane you can get when playing this game Seriously you can almost do anything you want if you know what youre doing The game even allows you to skip important stuff and doesnt outright punish you sure it may come with consequences or unexpected cons but the game really does let you roam and do whatever in almost any order you wish The world is yours to roam Act to Act

h1uModsuh1
Larian Studios didnt just give us the best game I had played in awhile but they are fully supportive of mods This is a MAJOR deal because now the lifespan has increased by 10 years Like Skyrim they have an official built in modding system to let you download pretty much whatever you want and sites letting you apply whatever kind of mod youre seeking Larian Studios even made an animation showcasing how wacky and fun you can get with mods thats just awesome Surprisingly most if not every mod I had obtained works perfectly fine with little to no issues fully functional Again I cant stress enough how mods for this game is really doing it favors and with Larian Studios supporting all mods this will make the game 200 better in the long run

h1uFlawsuh1
So it seemed like I had nothing but praise for the game But there are some flaws with it and I wont be shy as to what these flaws are If you really love something you should be allowed to give critics

The biggest issue I have with this game is how the companions AI acts when they follow you They tend to get stuck often and you have to manually move them to catch up Worse if you come across traps or dangerous areas your companions do not have any intelligence to avoid their demise Sure the spacebar immediately stops them in their tracks but that only helps so much until it really becomes a problem

I remember in Tactical Mode I had my party stop onto an elevator waited 5 seconds because I wanted to make sure theyd stop moving then suddenly when the elevator moved all my party fell to their deaths clipping from the bottom Many traps or shifting parts due to bugs which speaking of

Another major issue is how glitchy buggy and unstable Act 3 is entirely The first two Acts were solid hardly any problems but Act 3 is riddled with pugs Clipping through the floor some cutscenes have missing NPCs dialogue has no sound and sometimes my companions are just dead after a cutscene for no reason 

h1uHonour Modeuh1
So this one is my absolute pet peeve While the other issues were worse for general gameplay this mode is just horrible While I did like the challenge and Legendary Actions that bosses had what makes it really difficult to enjoy was the fact you only get 1 save file thats it I understand why they did this and you must live with your consequences and dealing with your battles but the fact this game has some issues and especially Act 3 being so buggy it ruins a lot of runs in Honour Mode

I ended up having to make backup saves on my computer just to bypass the unfair situations I dont mind dying and losing legit but when its outside my control and the game ends my run cause of a bug glitch or unexpected error thats when I decide enough is enough

h1uConclusionuh1
Baldurs Gate 3 is when you decide to not just make a game Its a story brought to life that you can replay and never get tired of A game that will leave you remembering it for years to come 95  10",0.884518265724182129,136,True,Beta Release,1739383360

As a DnD lover Ive waited for a long time to play a quality game based on DnD rules that doesnt smother you with tons of text but fully engages you in the game world

I played Original Sin 12 and the combat component didnt surprise me much  Larian has always made it good and here they also adapted the rules and features of DnD perfectly If youre not a fan of fighting you can just lower the difficulty dont spend a lot of time on it and just enjoy the story If you are the game surely will provide you with a challenge

But the most important thing is how the story is presented Many turnbased RPGs are very difficult to play for a long time There may be a good plot characters mechanics but they dont immerse you Here every dialog is voiced scenes are staged at the level of movies In some scenes you involuntarily say to yourself wow how good it is 

Its also really nice that you can play characters with a lot of completely different personalities you can act as a member of a certain class you can be a jester or a villain  whatever you want

Dear reader going into Baldurs Gate 3 I did not expect this battle between titans to change How pleasantly surprised I was to find a game clearly cared for by EVERYONE on the end credits Whether it is making me laugh out loud rage in anger at the villains or tear up thanks to powerful character arcs this game had me hooked like NO OTHER GAME 

I still cannot wrap my head around how complex and interwoven the storyline is and how it changes with your choices Some critics may say the changes are not super significant Well maybe not on the surface but countless times my decisions in the past have echoed their way to the present and I can be damned or blessed by my actions But it doesnt stop the game from progressing It is a wild thing to try to describe Sometimes you get a gut punch from life and you really realize how important your friends and family are That is this game I have not played a game that has felt this human ever before

174224668,76561198212792804,User,9,56261,Recommended,"I usually shun major AAA games in favor of small indie publishers So when this game first came out and got a lot of attention I ignored it thinking it was overrated Eventually my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to give Baldurs Gate 3 a try Boy have I been missing out

Game play and game mechanics are similar to Dungeons  Dragons There are nice tieins to the series that DD players including myself will appreciate such as certain races like elves and halfelves having dark vision critical successes and critical failures and classes like bards wizards and fighters One key difference between the game and DD is that in Baldurs Gate 3 instead of rolling initiative at the start of each turn initiative is rolled only once and remains locked in for the rest of combat Its not a feature but the most authentic part to DD are perception checks Just like DD your characters will fail almost all of their perception checks This is true even if they have high wisdom which affects perception and even if the switch or button or trap is an inch from their face Knowledge of DD isnt required to play though as there are tutorials for your first play through and game play is intuitive One caveat is that the early game is slow and not especially exciting Your party will fold over like lawn chairs from levels 13 especially the mages Things get more interesting at level 5 onward Thats when mages unlock powerful AOE spells and most classes gain second attacks

Where the game really shines is all of its content There are so many classes paladin barbarian fighter druid cleric bard and monk and just as many races too Many classes and races also have subclasses or subraces which allows indepth customization of your characters The only problem with this is customizing your first character assuming you dont choose a premade one can take a very long time especially if youre indecisive like me My first character Daelis was a Wild Magic Sorcerer and I had a cleric fighter and rogue in my party Each class felt distinct and was fun in their own way

The story was very enjoyable no spoilers here You are forced to make many tough irreversible decisions with farreaching consequences throughout this did raise my blood pressure at times but it also made everything feel more consequential I liked how my party members backstories diverged and intersected with the main story Each character was wellwritten and fullyfleshed out which made it feel like a real DD campaign There isnt much replayability when it comes to the main story You can make different decisions which can affect the ending but the overall story line remains the same Unlike DD there is only one campaign Things that surprised you in your first play through will be expected in the second Replayability is instead found in game play and quests Its impossible to complete every quest especially every party members unique quests in one play through All the different races and classes also give the game more replay value You can also recruit different party members than last time resulting in new character interactions

My only complaint is saving in the game There is an autosave system but it only activates after you enter important areas Youre forced to manually quicksave most of the time I eventually got the hang of it but it was annoying at first when I forgot to quicksave and lost progress I played on the Balanced difficulty which is essentially normal and struggled during many fights I had to reload old saves because my party kept dying or failing Thats more of a skill issue on my party than a problem with the game though If you play a lot of casual games and dont have experience with RPGs Id recommend the Narrative or easy mode Things will still be challenging its just your blood pressure wont spike as much

The game offers a wide selection for customization allowing you to choose your race background and class with the option to multiclass You can even customize your voice body type and your wiener Dialogues are influenced by your origin race and class Wizards and sorcerers can make fun of each other drows can intimidate others and companions might banter with you about whose god is the better one

If you dont want to create your own character you can play as one of the 7 Origin characters I recommend creating your own character or trying The Dark Urge He is unique as he is the only Origin character who doesnt appear in the story offering a unique playthrough you wont experience on a normal playthrough

The animations and facial expressions are impressive as well they bring life to both human and nonhuman races Even characters like dragonborns have expressive facial expressions

h3Companionsh3
The game features a huge cast of companions 10 each with their own distinct personalities and backstories Over time these companions evolve from strangers in your party to allies friends or romantic interests Companions dynamically react to your choices and to each other leading to surprising dialogues and conflicts Bringing specific companions to encounters can change how they unfold and you can influence their fatehelping them stay on their path or stray away from it The voice acting is also phenomenal Romances also features options for polymorphic or samesex relationships so no one missies out on Shadowheart or Halsin

Spoiler Alert If you dont want to miss an easily missable companionspoilerWhen you meet a drow named Minthara and if you get into a fight switch to nonlethal combat and knock her out instead of killing herspoiler

h3Open World and Explorationh3
The game does an amazing job with its story covering a wide range of topics with its central themes being trauma trust and personal growth There are three acts each offering many beautiful and memorable locations to explore Its openworld design lets you roam freely and NPCs dynamically react to your actions 

The world feels alive with consequences for your actions After 200 hours Im still finding hidden dialogues and secret details that surprise me making me appreciate the developers attention to detail

h3Gameplay and Mechanicsh3
The game offers many difficulty options from Explorer for those who just want to enjoy the story to Tactician for the minmaxers You can also play the game solo or in coop giving you the opportunity to experience the story with your friends

Combat is highly creative with spells and abilities that interact with the environment For example you can set up explosive barrels before an ambush or use water to create electrified surfaces Players can tackle obstacles in numerous wayscombat stealth magic or conversation This variety ensures you can tailor the story to your own playstyle

h3Flawsh3 
list
As with many openworld games bugs can arise due to its complex and detailed structure For example after killing a character NPCs might still refer to them as alive In one instance I exposed a thief disguised as a guard only to have him arrest me for stealing 
The nonlethal combat system while great for roleplay purposes doesnt change much regarding the story Knockedout characters are treated as dead in most cases with only a few exceptions
Lastly the game struggles to provide a meaningful evil playthrough While you can roleplay as morally grey or chaotic the evil with purpose path is underdeveloped Choosing the evil route frequently locks you out of story content companions and loot making it less rewarding compared to good or morally ambiguous paths
list

h3Moddingh3
The game supports modding through its official tools You can download mods for qualityoflife improvements like new hairstyles or face shapes to more substantial additions such as new classes or playable races For those who enjoy customizing further mods like the handsome Laezel option let you adjust her appearance though Baezel is already pretty stunning as she is

They also fix bugs really quickly sometimes within hours or days which is awesome

Im not even halfway through but I know from my kids that the ending doesnt let you down They are on their next playthrough right now and we cant wait for crossover coop to play it together 
I will definitely start a second playthrough alone too even though it IS a lot of work to go through it all again once youve discovered most secrets but 1 I want to romance another companion Gale next time D Sorry Astarion had to be the first 2 Ill choose higher difficulty now that Im comfortable with everything you can even change that midgame whenever you like But I want a bit more of a challenge right from the beginning next time and 3 I want to try out several mods after a vanilla playthrough So still a lot to look forward to in a second approach Most people will enjoy playing as a different class or something too which changes a lot in regards to the gameplay Im just too committed myself I ALWAYS play as a Druid in DnD and any CRPG that offers it thats just my thing Besides the story itself changes a lot when you choose different ways of action are moreless successfull discover things earlierlater the way the story unfolds is totally up to your choices and your luck and the class and specifications you went with its VERY versatile 
As for bugs I didnt encounter anything bad yet There are some glitches sometimes when managing BIG inventories like the one in camp  just close the inventory and open again and everything should act normal  and once I couldnt pick up a weapon that was knocked out of the characters hand in battle Thankfully I saved before the battle and just fought it again went far more smoothly the second time around anyway Other times I could pick up the weapon without a problem so its not a general bug just sometimes there may be small errors 

If you dont enjoy fighting at all there is a story mode thats quite relaxed really You can also adjust different aspects of difficulty in a custom setup even change how pricey things will be at merchants and change it for the current savegame any time you like so this should really fit any taste

My first playthrough of Baldurs Gate III took over 250 hours to complete just by walking around interacting with party members NPCs trying to complete every quest testing different builds Yet the game never felt like it was padding

Its no wonder a lot of AAA devs complained that this game overdelivers because it does in all aspects You can truly see the passion and dedication of Swen and his team with this title because its just so freaking massive yet by the end of final Act youre still left craving for more wanting to explore more of this beautifully crafted world and characters

h1Strengthsh1

 This game provides a fantastic almost accurate experience of 5th Edition Dungeons  Dragons The devs had to adapt a lot of the rules to fit the game format but if youve played DnD before then this will be easy to grasp

 I think the best part of this game is how much freedom you have to tackle on challenges and fights For example I play a lot of Stealth Strategy games like Commandos Desperados and Shadow Tactics so I really enjoy setting up my party members to dispatch bosses with few actions as possible striking with one character after the other while hiding There is a lot of player expression you dont see in any other game

 The character writing of this game reminds me a lot of BioWares which is poetic considering that Baldurs Gate I  II were made by them Nearly all character arcs feel satisfying Ive been craving for a game like this since the Mass Effect Trilogy Also if youve played the original Baldurs Gate games prepare for some nice surprises

 The replay value of Baldurs Gate III is absolutely gargantuan because there are different routes quest outcomes and small details that carry changes through the rest of the game Not to mention different classes to experience Youll often find yourself tempted to start fresh new save files to restart your journey with different classes and take different choices and I dont blame you

 The fact this game has on top of all that FULLY FUNCTIONAL ONLINE MULTIPLAYER WITH UP TO FOUR PEOPLE is the cherry on top Being able to play this game with friends and struggling to align the schedules is ridiculously fun and further adds replay value

 The modding community is very active and Patch 7 September 3rd 2024 even added an official mod manager and support ingame

h1Weaknessesh1

 Even on the lowest settings performance can sometimes tank a bit in large populated areas You may see a significant drops in FPS and some occasional CPU heavy fluctuations But overall this game is very well optimized

 I feel this game couldve done a better job with some of the tutorials For instance you can fail or even downright miss quests if you long rest too much depending on which part of the game you are

 The game rewards murder hoboing a bit too much You still get experience for milestones discovering new locations completing quests without killing etc but if you want to maximize experience gained its easier to just slaughter everything

 Online multiplayer can be very unstable if the other players are on the GoG version of the game Lets hope theyll fix that once crossplay arrives in Patch 8

 The final Act feels a bit lackluster in some aspects not to mention the gauntlet of fights leading to the final battle being a bit disappointing No spoilers but I was expecting something more way more flashy and bombastic

I saw this game a year ago and was hesitant to try it due to the turnbased combat and having absolutely no prior experience with DD I gave in recently due to wanting a new game to play and oh boy was I wrong This is truly a masterpiece the level of depth in this game is insane It has completely changed my perspective on this style of game and DD as a whole

At first the abundance of options during character creation truly overwhelmed me resulting in me spending 6 hours on it alone But Im glad its there because it just makes it that much more replayable This level of choice continues throughout the game ensuring your experience is what you want it to be

Most of these longer story games end up tiring me out so I just rush through to the end to not feel like Ive wasted the time I spent on it already BG3 is an exception to that despite being the longest game out of all of them I truly enjoyed the whole journey

Before I even finished the game I already couldnt wait to do another playthrough with mods and different choices Now that I have finished the game I can confidently say that the feeling hasnt changed and Ill be doing another playthrough in the future probably an evil one",0.863706111907958984,90,True,Early Access,1725901667

Its a true role playing experience and is almost sandboxlike despite having such a massive established world already The creative freedom is insane You can sit there and read through the well written story with amazing characters explore all the side content and really engage with the world or you can play strictly for the fun gameplay skipping over the story to spend time doing stupid creative things like stacking up boxes to set up for a skydiving owlbear or going on a murder rampage and killing everyone Its amazing how the game has so many avenues of play that you can choose to engage with or not based on your own roleplaying experience

This game also has some of my favourite RPG mechanics of any game drawing from DND combat and their past games such as DOS2 It translates excellently into the 3D format You can pace the difficulty how you want by taking rests when needed Multiclassing is awesome in this game and the gear you can find to augment your abilities opens up so much I do miss the elemental combat of DOS2 but there is many reasons that this game is better  namely the universal actions such as jumping and repositioning options shoving etc add a lot of whismy to the game You can go and blast things with a fireball or you can throw your little gnome friend at the enemy and then have him shove a guy off a cliff Theres a lot of potential for fun coop play",0.558394193649291992,12,True,Alpha Release,1739212422
190606477,76561198161926827,User,2,47906,Recommended,"I literally cant express how much I love this game Ive gone through at least 10 or so full runs and I still have the itch to play again because of how well written it is and because of how fun it is Its been so long since I played a game that could suck me into its world and keep me there even now and I only wish that I could delete the game from my brain so I could experience it all over again for the first time 

Okay my very biased opinion aside the stuff this game does well is the story the lore and the worldbuilding Its an RPG so you know youre in for a lot of reading and talking and this game is FULL of material From reading all the books and documents throughout the world to talking to a cat trying to convince you to follow its cat god I can guarantee with all the time you spend in this game youll get your moneys worth ten times over And I can tell you that only playing this game once is a disservice to all the story they managed to stuff into it so to really experience a decent portion of the game I recommend playing at the very LEAST two runs as your silly little OC Tav and as The Dark Urge in that order

And as far as game mechanics go its all turnbased homie so if you dont like that very much you may not enjoy the game especially if youre playing multiplayer and you know your friends are the type to take a turn and then tab out immediately and have to be reminded to get back in there especially if they arent as invested in the world and story as you are Like I said its a lot of reading and a lot of exposition so this game isnt going to appeal to everyone especially if they arent thepatient type andor just dont have the attention span to keep them locked in

Another super fun part are the companions Theres a whole myriad of companion characters you can find in the game that tag along on your journey and if you play your cards right can be romanced Or if you aint into that you can all by besties and take Faerun by storm And all of those companions can be played by you the player I call them Origin Runs and playing as them all give a new perspective when running around the world so highly recommend doing that too

Okay sorry I really tried to write pros and cons but again Im so biased lmao but I hope this helped some people take the plunge or steer clear if aint your cup of tea And last but not least thank you Larian for raising the bar Thanks for reading _

The game is really more of a sequel to Divinity Original Sin 2 than it is one for Baldurs Gate 2 You choose between six main characters four of whom end up in your party though thankfully this game allows you to recruit them all and swap between them at will The quests layout inventory and act structure are all identical to DOS2 Halfway through the game you end up with a couple of returning characters and fun call backs to BG2 but for the most part this can be treated as a standalone story

h1uLegendary Masterpieceuh1
Just no other way of saying it Larian Studios took their time and crafted perhaps one of the most memorable games I had the pleasure playing in It is incredible on so many levels I actually have a hard time believing it even exits Now theres definitely some flaws with it not a true perfect game but its as close as you can imagine

h1uGameplayuh1
It really plays out like youre in a DND 5e tabletop but beyond what most would had expected It didnt just make an adaption or inspiration its a love letter to DND 5e and im here for it Gameplay is very smooth feels great with mouse and keyboard plus so much to do both in and outside combat Sure the turn based combat is the main sell but its also got a lot more going for it and those who love roleplaying and exploring while engaging with puzzles npcs and finding secrets its all here Its probably the most well designed tabletop game in the market

h1uGraphics and Storyuh1
Game is breathtaking and looks like a beautiful panting where ever you go All locations and settings in this world is brimming with life and I love how the characters are designed too So much effort went into how the game looks and its marvelous to behold seeing for yourself

The writing is straight up fire Every quest every arc in Acts 1 2 and 3 were just immersive to delve into Never did I get tired or bored of any quests no matter how small The main story is also incredibly well crafted and I bet many DMs Dungeon Masters will take much inspiration from this game Such a fantastic journey where you want to do everything the game offers going out of your way to learn more about the world what you can learn from it and completing quests just to hear more about this place Baldurs Gate 3 resides in

Your choices VERY much matter here There is no illusion or just going with the ride everything you do has either a small significant or major impact on the story No choice ever feels like it didnt matter and even story bits can change depending on what you do first like a DM adapting to how you play and NPCs can change entirely based on how successful good or horrible you are

h1uCharactersuh1
Never had I imagined any game topping the Mass Effect Trilogy in terms of developed characters But wow this is very much the only time in recent memory if ever that I loved all the characters The voice acting is just peak performance the traits and personalities of each character is so developed and they really feel like people You always experience something new with an NPC in this game no matter what playthrough theres dialogue or something you find out about them that makes you love them more Every opportunity I wanted to engage and talk to my companions completing quests with them and tangle in both friendships and relationships Not a single NPC was poorly written not one What a huge feat Larian Studios did here this is so hard to pull off but they nailed it Some companions legit made me cry irl just cause of how extremely touching or tragic segments were that left me thinking about it in my sleep

What makes these characters even more amazing is unlike Mass Effect they legit can leave you hate you or even want to fight  murder you depending on your choices They dont just tag along they have thoughts views morals and goals They do react to almost everything you do and will have actual things to say which does have impact on how the journey goes This aspect is what makes them so memorable to begin with

h1uFreedomsuh1
So one of the strongest pros of this game besides the unbelievably well written characters is how much you can do outside the box The game doesnt force you to play by the usual rules you can get really creative in and out of combat The game literally lets you cheese to your hearts content or do things even the game didnt expect you to do but youre able to With how the game is designed any object can be used in numerous ways you can do so many challenge runs with what you have at your disposal and I keep seeing people on other sites and Youtube show off just how insane you can get when playing this game Seriously you can almost do anything you want if you know what youre doing The game even allows you to skip important stuff and doesnt outright punish you sure it may come with consequences or unexpected cons but the game really does let you roam and do whatever in almost any order you wish The world is yours to roam Act to Act

h1uModsuh1
Larian Studios didnt just give us the best game I had played in awhile but they are fully supportive of mods This is a MAJOR deal because now the lifespan has increased by 10 years Like Skyrim they have an official built in modding system to let you download pretty much whatever you want and sites letting you apply whatever kind of mod youre seeking Larian Studios even made an animation showcasing how wacky and fun you can get with mods thats just awesome Surprisingly most if not every mod I had obtained works perfectly fine with little to no issues fully functional Again I cant stress enough how mods for this game is really doing it favors and with Larian Studios supporting all mods this will make the game 200 better in the long run

h1uFlawsuh1
So it seemed like I had nothing but praise for the game But there are some flaws with it and I wont be shy as to what these flaws are If you really love something you should be allowed to give critics

The biggest issue I have with this game is how the companions AI acts when they follow you They tend to get stuck often and you have to manually move them to catch up Worse if you come across traps or dangerous areas your companions do not have any intelligence to avoid their demise Sure the spacebar immediately stops them in their tracks but that only helps so much until it really becomes a problem

I remember in Tactical Mode I had my party stop onto an elevator waited 5 seconds because I wanted to make sure theyd stop moving then suddenly when the elevator moved all my party fell to their deaths clipping from the bottom Many traps or shifting parts due to bugs which speaking of

Another major issue is how glitchy buggy and unstable Act 3 is entirely The first two Acts were solid hardly any problems but Act 3 is riddled with pugs Clipping through the floor some cutscenes have missing NPCs dialogue has no sound and sometimes my companions are just dead after a cutscene for no reason 

h1uHonour Modeuh1
So this one is my absolute pet peeve While the other issues were worse for general gameplay this mode is just horrible While I did like the challenge and Legendary Actions that bosses had what makes it really difficult to enjoy was the fact you only get 1 save file thats it I understand why they did this and you must live with your consequences and dealing with your battles but the fact this game has some issues and especially Act 3 being so buggy it ruins a lot of runs in Honour Mode

I ended up having to make backup saves on my computer just to bypass the unfair situations I dont mind dying and losing legit but when its outside my control and the game ends my run cause of a bug glitch or unexpected error thats when I decide enough is enough

h1uConclusionuh1
Baldurs Gate 3 is when you decide to not just make a game Its a story brought to life that you can replay and never get tired of A game that will leave you remembering it for years to come 95  10",0.884518265724182129,136,True,Alpha Release,1739383360

It is absolutely beautiful amazing not to mention SEXY characters and incredible interpersonal development plus endless possibilities making replayability so effortless and rewarding I have never played a game over and over again let alone immediately after finishing it and while playing continuously thinking about how Id go about changing it up on my next play through The only thing that I always do on every play through is talk to EVERY cat I possibly can especially His Majesty and Steelclaw plus dont forget to find and chat with Malta

167551362,76561198009723453,Curator,61,2031,Not Recommended,"To be brief its Divinity with worse gameplay and better polish The nebulous term Gameplay is going to be the focus of this review because my opinion is firmly stuck on that being the most important part of a game arbitrarily or otherwise Skip the review if you dont care

Most D20 systems by their very design are incredibly random and this is fine in a tabletop environment with friends where youre all going on this journey together and the hand dealt isnt always optimal but you have fun learning about things in the process  Plus it has a DM that can fudge the rolls from time to time from behind the screen so that players doing impressive and cool things can be rewarded by just pretending that they nat 20d or something This for me does not work in a preset unchanging environment like the one found in this game

This isnt a problem with RNG as a whole just the breadth of it within BG3s design which Id assume is a problem that arose from trying to graft the DD ruleset exactly how it is onto a videogame without making enough concessions for the adaptation process Different games handle this in different ways Disco Elysium uses a 2d6 system so that your roll bonuses are more impactful even early on due to the smaller window of possible results whilst also including a bunch of situational bonuses depending on prior decisions Fallout NV removes RNG entirely by just allowing you to talk about the things that your skills say you have the knowhow to talk about DDs Everyone can succeed and everyone can fail mentality is suitable for the tabletop  but since the other characters wont really have many interactions with your bad rolls the story cant change too drastically because of them and the DM cant make silly things happen in response the one true difference between this and the tabletop begins to shine through Reloading

Outside of Ironman modes all of these games allow you to just fail a check and then reload to roll it again which begs the question why any of these games even bother to have dice rolls at all except to waste your time reloading when the coin flip fails or more likely to better simulate the tabletop game experience for its own sake

Your choices only matter when you want them to matter so you might as well install a mod that bypasses every single roll in dialogue and youd have the exact same experience just much quicker There is nothing enjoyable in the failures in dialogue theres no Harry to leap through the air flipping the double bird only to crash into a disabled NPC theres no silliness added in  Its all very classy its all played surprisingly safe despite how horny it is Granted this isnt what fully kills the game for me Im not averse to CYOA books after all

The issues of gameplay are much more prevalent in the combat which suffers the same weird RNG problems as the dialogue with the same savescumming possibilities and somehow fewer options DDs combat system especially 5Es is so simple that anyone can pick it up and play it at a table with nothing but some dice and some scraps of paper This is great for the tabletop where nothing is automated and it works fine in the game  Its just so unbearably dull for me

There are so many different variables in play about the shape of the map and where you can stand good vantage points for ranged attacks or chokepoints to prevent approaches theres different status ailments and a dizzying array of damage types weird surface conditions and even the light level  But in the three attempts I had of this game all on different difficulties none of that really mattered Sure itd be cool in the tabletop to stealthily shoot out a lit candle so your opponents cant see you as well and have a nice narrative moment where your allies can quip even if you bollocks it up in BG3 theres no real need to do anything other than march full speed into your enemies faces and spam whatever abilities you like best until the rolls have determined that youve won and then immediately long rest

The games difficulty and complexity are rendered moot by the wealth of perfectly viable options the presence of more viable options at all is rendered moot by the wildness of a D20 and any differences between the viability of those options is rendered moot by the ability to reload a save and succeed no matter what Tactician modes combat difficulty had two speeds Standard and nearly impossible without savescumming brought on entirely by when in your progress you choose to approach an encounter It added in JRPG grindingforbeefgates into this DD game without any direct indication For the record Im cool with JRPG grinding its just strange to see it here in a game that isnt conducive to it Tactician doesnt make the game more Tactical as the most effective strategy I can think of off the top of my head is to have 4 Warlocks using max range Eldritch Blast on everyone and just praying that the hit and damage dice both roll high If they dont roll high reload You werent going to win anyway The game never requires you to interact with all this stuff that effort went into making is what Im getting at here 

Combat feels like a weirdly easy slog and despite all of the different abilities and classes none of them really feel all that different to one another The key differences seem to be what your effective range is whether or not you can heal and how many times you can attack in a single turn or between rests everything else ends up just being variations of the same gameplay loop for every character Maybe at Level 20 theres some secret sauce Im missing but the game can just not hold my attention long enough with its FisherPrice mechanics to have me journey beyond Act 2

Its hard to describe exactly why its like this
Maybe its the hard action limit per turn
So many buffs and alterations are full actions when they feel like they should be bonus actions It might be the AP system alone that prevents me from having the same gripes with Divinity 2 

Maybe its the lack of impact or indication that all of these different damage types are actually doing something outside of Well that enemy looks like its a bit on fire so I wont use fire on it  Divinity 2s exploding poison puddles were always good for a laugh

The real problem is likely not with the game but with me and people like me who have bothered to read all this way into the review who just want games to be more engaging than they are perhaps meant to be

I almost want to say I dont know who this game is for which is bizarre and hilarious since its such a popular and wellreceived game It appears to be for everybody Its narrative has gore violence dark themes sex even genitalia on the character creation screen but then once the nittygritty of the gameplay rears its ugly head it turns into Snakes  Ladders Its like the opposite of a mascot platformer

If you enjoy it more power to you I kind of envy that I genuinely wish I could just overlook the games boring combat to enjoy the parts about it that are actually pretty decent  My last attempt was even on the easiest difficulty so that I could just blitz through it as fast as possible but it was still too much of a bugbear to get over

tldr
Gameplay over all You can still have the other things too just do good gameplay first pls If you agree with that skip this game

This review implies I know what good gameplay is obviously Lol

The one positive thing I can share that isnt immediately obviously present in the blue reviews is that Im glad that what is essentially ERPing with someones OCs is not only more widely accepted now but one of this games key selling points

190475153,76561198359505709,User,5,10548,Not Recommended,"I really liked this game when it came out as someone who played it from day one but recent decisions made by Larian regarding character writing and actual stakes in this game have become more and more frustrating as patches come out
It feels like they dont want the player to actually be challenged or faced with any party dilemmas anymore like how other choice based games like Mass Effect do so have taken every possible opportunity to remove serious consequences that used to be present when the game first dropped 
Compelling scenes with certain characters have been completely removed or made null by the ability to brute force your way to the desired result instead of being faced with consequences for your choices and it feels like characters who were originally very morally grey with depth The Emperor for example have been forcefully rewritten to be as black and white as possible while other characters are absolutely left behind in terms of content while others are given way too much attention so it makes things feel very lopsided Ex Wyll getting scraps while Astarion seems to get new content every damn patch
It has gotten to the point where I need to install mods to recover cut content that was actually really good because Larian keeps removing it even though there was nothing wrong with it to begin with 
It feels like they dont want the players to be challenged or compelled by the story at all and it has hurt the once stellar writing that actually made you think and reconsider your choices and feel the weight of your actions
The game itself is still fun to play gameplay wise but the story has just been battered to the point its a shell of its former self and it makes me sad since it used to offer so much to the table and now it feels like its trying to hold your hand at every turn while throwing out all the parts that contributed to it winning its writing award
I hope this improves at some point but I doubt it will considering the trajectory things seem to be headed in so I reccomend players look for mods like the restored Wyrmway cutscene to recover the lost content that used to make the story great if thats what they are looking for if story doesnt matter too much to you then you should still be fine",0.556166350841522217,12,True,Alpha Release,1742233207

Such an incredibly immersive game Never before could I enjoy a more storyrich game I am that person who skips dialogue because I just want to get to the good part But in Baldurs Gate 3 the dialogue is part of the good part I enjoy conversations side quests and feel like characters could just be real people I still have not been able to bring myself to be evil in this game I dont want to hurt the feelings of the pixels on my screen The companions are amazing the set pieces crafted are amazing 

In the past I would also never be able to imagine enjoying a game with turnbased combat But I love spending 12 hours on an encounter figuring out the best strategies my nondnd mind can come up with Overtime playing this game you can actually learn thinking out of the box more and more making a new playtrough feel new and free 

I think I like this game and it made me more of a nerdy freak

As a DnD lover Ive waited for a long time to play a quality game based on DnD rules that doesnt smother you with tons of text but fully engages you in the game world

I played Original Sin 12 and the combat component didnt surprise me much  Larian has always made it good and here they also adapted the rules and features of DnD perfectly If youre not a fan of fighting you can just lower the difficulty dont spend a lot of time on it and just enjoy the story If you are the game surely will provide you with a challenge

But the most important thing is how the story is presented Many turnbased RPGs are very difficult to play for a long time There may be a good plot characters mechanics but they dont immerse you Here every dialog is voiced scenes are staged at the level of movies In some scenes you involuntarily say to yourself wow how good it is 

Its also really nice that you can play characters with a lot of completely different personalities you can act as a member of a certain class you can be a jester or a villain  whatever you want

I saw this game a year ago and was hesitant to try it due to the turnbased combat and having absolutely no prior experience with DD I gave in recently due to wanting a new game to play and oh boy was I wrong This is truly a masterpiece the level of depth in this game is insane It has completely changed my perspective on this style of game and DD as a whole

At first the abundance of options during character creation truly overwhelmed me resulting in me spending 6 hours on it alone But Im glad its there because it just makes it that much more replayable This level of choice continues throughout the game ensuring your experience is what you want it to be

Most of these longer story games end up tiring me out so I just rush through to the end to not feel like Ive wasted the time I spent on it already BG3 is an exception to that despite being the longest game out of all of them I truly enjoyed the whole journey

Before I even finished the game I already couldnt wait to do another playthrough with mods and different choices Now that I have finished the game I can confidently say that the feeling hasnt changed and Ill be doing another playthrough in the future probably an evil one",0.863706111907958984,90,True,Beta Release,1725901667

Combat exploration and dialogue are the foundation of the genre and Baldurs Gate 3 does each expertly

The whole game itself doesnt hold your hand during the game but it does help you build up your skills and learn how to play as you go which is great for those who havent played CRPG turn based game before I have basically played this nonstop since October to pass time and as you can see with my 527 hours on record I absolutely LOVE this game The options for responses and endings are endless Im thoroughly blown away with the voice acting and yes the mod options There are many people who hate playing with mods but to me it adds a lot to the game and enhances my game play experience making me want to play it more I have done numerous campaigns and as of January 2025 Im doing my 2nd durge campaign trying to play a somewhat evil character which is hard as Ive cried from being evil to pixels haha 

Overall I think this game may be the best game Ive ever played and I love how Larian and the VAs show their active participation in the community along with Larian giving us FREE updates and gives modders the toolkit This company couldve charged 100 or more for this game with the amount of work and thought put into it along with the again FREE updates but they didnt They have shown they care more for the players experience and making a game that out beats other new games and certain ahem developers AHEM Bethesda by giving us a game that is completed at release from what Ive been told by other gamers who played this at release I recommend this game to anyone who wants a rich fulfilling game that doesnt have any extra catches outside the initial price",0.803736507892608643,79,True,Beta Release,1736855900

First I am not a big fan of 5e as a CRPG Its too simple for a deep crunch It always leaves me wanting more crunch to bite into or leaves me wanting it to go a ton faster I think some of Larians changes to the game help it but it still leaves me just wanting more and not in a good way I dont get excited about leveling up because of the lack of choices many classes have 

Second The companions I think when I got to act 3 I basically enjoyed 2 of them When I first played this in EA everyone was saying oh this is only half of the companions we will get this is all the evil ones they will have a bunch of other ones added in the end etc and in the end that was kinda a lie Basically outside of the main 5 the rest that are there feel even more flat and not fleshed out than the main 5 And I can barely stand the main 5 One of the biggest things I enjoyed about DOS2 and other CRPGS is the companions they add life to the game These companions suck away the life from the game for me 

Three Act 3 Yea this felt like a huge letdown When I first got to around the time the game came out it was unplayable on my comp Now its better but still kinda a huge letdown It feels so unfinished Its the same thing with DOS2 the game is so frontloaded and goes out on what feels like a whimper The big bads of the area feel like they barely thought them out and I was just left dissapointed

Four The vibes I dunno how to describe this but the game is very nouveau dnd Its kinda goofy non serious while still trying to be serious It has the same vibes I got while playing a bunch of dnd5e games kinda goofy superhero character driven while not really caring about the world story etc Its just really hard to describe how I feel but the vibes are just something I never clicked with

I feel like there is more like how some choices end up being nonchoices and not mattering spoiler illithid powers use spoiler and just other random things that kinda just picked at me


I dunno overall I really did want to like it but typically I would go back to a crpg to play a second or third time I love playing games but this games just really makes me not want to play it again I just get bored and uninspired while playing it which I feel like isnt a good thing",0.548510074615478516,59,False,Beta Release,1722694544

My first playthrough of Baldurs Gate III took over 250 hours to complete just by walking around interacting with party members NPCs trying to complete every quest testing different builds Yet the game never felt like it was padding

Its no wonder a lot of AAA devs complained that this game overdelivers because it does in all aspects You can truly see the passion and dedication of Swen and his team with this title because its just so freaking massive yet by the end of final Act youre still left craving for more wanting to explore more of this beautifully crafted world and characters

hrhr

h1Strengthsh1

 This game provides a fantastic almost accurate experience of 5th Edition Dungeons  Dragons The devs had to adapt a lot of the rules to fit the game format but if youve played DnD before then this will be easy to grasp

 I think the best part of this game is how much freedom you have to tackle on challenges and fights For example I play a lot of Stealth Strategy games like Commandos Desperados and Shadow Tactics so I really enjoy setting up my party members to dispatch bosses with few actions as possible striking with one character after the other while hiding There is a lot of player expression you dont see in any other game

 The character writing of this game reminds me a lot of BioWares which is poetic considering that Baldurs Gate I  II were made by them Nearly all character arcs feel satisfying Ive been craving for a game like this since the Mass Effect Trilogy Also if youve played the original Baldurs Gate games prepare for some nice surprises

 The replay value of Baldurs Gate III is absolutely gargantuan because there are different routes quest outcomes and small details that carry changes through the rest of the game Not to mention different classes to experience Youll often find yourself tempted to start fresh new save files to restart your journey with different classes and take different choices and I dont blame you

 The fact this game has on top of all that FULLY FUNCTIONAL ONLINE MULTIPLAYER WITH UP TO FOUR PEOPLE is the cherry on top Being able to play this game with friends and struggling to align the schedules is ridiculously fun and further adds replay value

 The modding community is very active and Patch 7 September 3rd 2024 even added an official mod manager and support ingame

h1Weaknessesh1

 Even on the lowest settings performance can sometimes tank a bit in large populated areas You may see a significant drops in FPS and some occasional CPU heavy fluctuations But overall this game is very well optimized

 I feel this game couldve done a better job with some of the tutorials For instance you can fail or even downright miss quests if you long rest too much depending on which part of the game you are

 The game rewards murder hoboing a bit too much You still get experience for milestones discovering new locations completing quests without killing etc but if you want to maximize experience gained its easier to just slaughter everything

 Online multiplayer can be very unstable if the other players are on the GoG version of the game Lets hope theyll fix that once crossplay arrives in Patch 8

 The final Act feels a bit lackluster in some aspects not to mention the gauntlet of fights leading to the final battle being a bit disappointing No spoilers but I was expecting something more way more flashy and bombastic

hrhr

Baldurs Gate III winning Game of the Year in 2023 is a testament that gamers just want fun complete experiences that respect their time and dont try to exploit their wallets with lootboxes season passes and cashgrab microtransactions Crazy huh

Its a shame we wont get an expansion or DLC for this game but I frankly cant wait to see what Larian is cooking whether its Divinity Original Sin 3 or a brand new IP Im sure theyll apply everything they learned with Baldurs Gate III and blow our minds once again",0.908775031566619873,364,True,Early Access,1722888384

Genuinely I love this game and I didnt believe the others that said Act 3 is a ilarge problemi It is I get it now I also want to fight whoever is personally responsible for rushing this game
It is iso so goodi but unfortunately there are glitches that are genuinely game breaking as in you physically cannot play the game when it happens That and instructions and quest lines in Act 3 are unclear at best and nonexistent at worst

Once the issues that istop you from playing the game entirelyi are fixed Id be happy to change my review Unfortunately there are some that are even showing up as early as Act 2 Heres a little list of things I have run into that granted iI do see them trying to patchi but are unfortunately still issues as of this review

bGetting stuck in dialoguesb Either you enter the dialogue and no options pop up or you are counted as in dialogue and nothing else happens You are simply stranded immovable and inactive until a team mate can either pull you far enough away to end the convo or worse yet has to kill you to avoid having to load a save that was a whole half hour ago
bGetting stuck at 100 loadsb I am unsure why this happens but sometimes loading a save will cause the game to load to completion and then never actually put you in the game This one is extra annoying because the entire party will have to AltF4 the game or use Task Manager to kill it because even if the host kills it the other players are still stuck
bBugging out when trying to assign characters to the correct playersb I am unsure why this happens but sometimes when swapping characters between people they will both lose the ability to use either character entirely as well as any summons attached to them Usually the host will have to reboot the save and pray the above issue doesnt happen

There are also some things that dont stop you from playing the game but can badly hinder the experience

bFights and encounters during long restsb If the host starts a long rest before all players have successfully joined they cannot enter the game until the long rest is completed This also forces them to miss any encounters that happen during that time You wouldnt think this would be so bad as most of the encounters during rests are minor and unimportant iButb There are a few very very important ones namely with your dream visitor Spoilers ahead on that spoilerWe had this happen on the encounter with The Emperor when he reveals his true identity The entire fight the reveal and the option to become half Illithid were all missed by myself and I happen to be the one romancing him and gunning to become an Illithidspoiler Personally I think if there is any combat going on during a long rest that players should be able to join there not just for what I just mentioned but also because the host likely does not want to deal with the entire encounter with their team mates characters that they do not know how to play
bTurning invisible for no particular reasonb This one is not too bad but it is highly annoying and admittedly really ruins the immersion and playing experience
bAnimation rig glitching during cutscenesb This one could get a pass but it is a liiiiittle distracting to try and have a serious in game conversation romances for example where the head rig completely breaks at the neck for a few seconds Again immersion
bLack of clarity on what you are supposed to dob I am looking particularly at Act 3 for this one Im not expecting it to hold your hand but some clarity would be nice The quests in that act like to tell you some vague thing you need to go get done and then not give you a place to start Worse yet sometimes it will point it out for you on the map in completely the wrong location if it gives you a location at all I never had to use that function until act 3 and a good couple quests give you a location that is nowhere near where the actual place you need to go is at Other times they give you the name of a location and then refuse to give you any guidance as to where the heck that is In particular spoilerthe Murder Mystery quest to locate Orinspoiler really likes to tell you to go do things and give you no good direction to start looking and infuriatingly is non optional spoilerif you want to kill her firstspoiler If you want to go the other route spoiler the quest marker for Gortash actually points you to the passage downstairs instead of upstairs where he actually isspoiler All of this is fine and dandy if you are playing the whole thing in one go If you are playing it in short spurts you will likely forget a lot of things and wind up on a goose chase It really doesnt come off fun or clever to me at all just infuriatingly annoying

187137180,76561198049344712,User,12,6046,Not Recommended,"A very mediocre experience

Act 1 Okish
Act 2 Show starts to crumble
Act 3 Made me quit and uninstall

Storyplot ranging from mediocre ok to borderline stupid 
Oddly disjointed plot events
Expect attempts at edginess
Expect pacing issues
Mcguffins galore gotta get that lantern to fend off that eeeevil fog
Expect cringy characters ie angelic lesbian at the tavern
The spook haunting your camp is a strange design choice
Pocket dimension camp and dream sequences are yet again a strange lazy design choices
Murderhobo levels of combat had me dreading whats up around the next corner and sometimes rage quitting
Combat can get very slow with more than a few enemies  expect to overstay their welcome
QoL issues with stuff like swapping companions 
Mediocre UI
Expect to fight the camera every now and then
YMMV but brace for bugs and glitches
Far too much sex and thirsty companions
Does your GOTY require genital customization
Expect issues with coop
Ultra epic background stories for level 2 companions  feel speechul yet
Ultra epic story lines and Mcguffins 
In a really strange fashion  misclicking is a thing in this game
Its quite possible to get confused and think youre actually in DOS game
Expect Larian cheese tactics
Your are the avatar of the god of leaping and shoving they truly are awesome
Expect difficulty spikes
Expect underwhelming itemization and loot
Initial sense of urgency is sort of tossed out the window what was bad is now kinda good
Far too much rng and unskippable dice throws for more or less everything and anything
Expect to feel like the game cheats at times fights can be determined by rng
Expect mandatory save scumming
Expect frequent cut scenes
Expect wrong characters to start up conversations etc
Expect pathing issues ie characters walking into traps
Expect possible framerate drops and the alikes
Expect not to rely on autosaves
Expect fairly long load times
No true pause button 

I guess I could go on and on but Im sure youi get the jist
Get it from a sale if you must cannot recommend in any other form

The plethora of character customizations combined with vast class options makes for the ultimate way to experience DD as a game with simpler and easier rules to follow The worldbuilding character development and consequences of your smallest choices or failed rolls dialogue checks lead to endless replayability and one of the most immersive experiences in gaming history The combat requires patience at times but the freedom and robustness of its systems more than make up for being turnbased once youve adjusted You can do anything from turning the battlefield into flooded fields bouncing with bolts of lightning to using the enemies themselves as weapons

Soooo much content it just blows your mind simply epic Wonderful graphics and voice acting good gameplay mechanics interesting characters and good story I wholeheartidly love everything about this 
Im not even halfway through but I know from my kids that the ending doesnt let you down They are on their next playthrough right now and we cant wait for crossover coop to play it together 
I will definitely start a second playthrough alone too even though it IS a lot of work to go through it all again once youve discovered most secrets but 1 I want to romance another companion Gale next time D Sorry Astarion had to be the first 2 Ill choose higher difficulty now that Im comfortable with everything you can even change that midgame whenever you like But I want a bit more of a challenge right from the beginning next time and 3 I want to try out several mods after a vanilla playthrough So still a lot to look forward to in a second approach Most people will enjoy playing as a different class or something too which changes a lot in regards to the gameplay Im just too committed myself I ALWAYS play as a Druid in DnD and any CRPG that offers it thats just my thing Besides the story itself changes a lot when you choose different ways of action are moreless successfull discover things earlierlater the way the story unfolds is totally up to your choices and your luck and the class and specifications you went with its VERY versatile 
As for bugs I didnt encounter anything bad yet There are some glitches sometimes when managing BIG inventories like the one in camp  just close the inventory and open again and everything should act normal  and once I couldnt pick up a weapon that was knocked out of the characters hand in battle Thankfully I saved before the battle and just fought it again went far more smoothly the second time around anyway Other times I could pick up the weapon without a problem so its not a general bug just sometimes there may be small errors 

If you dont enjoy fighting at all there is a story mode thats quite relaxed really You can also adjust different aspects of difficulty in a custom setup even change how pricey things will be at merchants and change it for the current savegame any time you like so this should really fit any taste

The game is really more of a sequel to Divinity Original Sin 2 than it is one for Baldurs Gate 2 You choose between six main characters four of whom end up in your party though thankfully this game allows you to recruit them all and swap between them at will The quests layout inventory and act structure are all identical to DOS2 Halfway through the game you end up with a couple of returning characters and fun call backs to BG2 but for the most part this can be treated as a standalone story

187760636,76561198046999341,User,71,16027,Recommended,"bNote This review came out very late because Baldurs Game 3 is something you just cant rush I really wanted to know my final thoughts after not replaying it once but trying different stories paths and modes like Honour Mode This review is late but I feel I finally have gathered my thoughtsb

h1uLegendary Masterpieceuh1
Just no other way of saying it Larian Studios took their time and crafted perhaps one of the most memorable games I had the pleasure playing in It is incredible on so many levels I actually have a hard time believing it even exits Now theres definitely some flaws with it not a true perfect game but its as close as you can imagine

h1uGameplayuh1
It really plays out like youre in a DND 5e tabletop but beyond what most would had expected It didnt just make an adaption or inspiration its a love letter to DND 5e and im here for it Gameplay is very smooth feels great with mouse and keyboard plus so much to do both in and outside combat Sure the turn based combat is the main sell but its also got a lot more going for it and those who love roleplaying and exploring while engaging with puzzles npcs and finding secrets its all here Its probably the most well designed tabletop game in the market

h1uGraphics and Storyuh1
Game is breathtaking and looks like a beautiful panting where ever you go All locations and settings in this world is brimming with life and I love how the characters are designed too So much effort went into how the game looks and its marvelous to behold seeing for yourself

The writing is straight up fire Every quest every arc in Acts 1 2 and 3 were just immersive to delve into Never did I get tired or bored of any quests no matter how small The main story is also incredibly well crafted and I bet many DMs Dungeon Masters will take much inspiration from this game Such a fantastic journey where you want to do everything the game offers going out of your way to learn more about the world what you can learn from it and completing quests just to hear more about this place Baldurs Gate 3 resides in

Your choices VERY much matter here There is no illusion or just going with the ride everything you do has either a small significant or major impact on the story No choice ever feels like it didnt matter and even story bits can change depending on what you do first like a DM adapting to how you play and NPCs can change entirely based on how successful good or horrible you are

h1uCharactersuh1
Never had I imagined any game topping the Mass Effect Trilogy in terms of developed characters But wow this is very much the only time in recent memory if ever that I loved all the characters The voice acting is just peak performance the traits and personalities of each character is so developed and they really feel like people You always experience something new with an NPC in this game no matter what playthrough theres dialogue or something you find out about them that makes you love them more Every opportunity I wanted to engage and talk to my companions completing quests with them and tangle in both friendships and relationships Not a single NPC was poorly written not one What a huge feat Larian Studios did here this is so hard to pull off but they nailed it Some companions legit made me cry irl just cause of how extremely touching or tragic segments were that left me thinking about it in my sleep

What makes these characters even more amazing is unlike Mass Effect they legit can leave you hate you or even want to fight  murder you depending on your choices They dont just tag along they have thoughts views morals and goals They do react to almost everything you do and will have actual things to say which does have impact on how the journey goes This aspect is what makes them so memorable to begin with

h1uFreedomsuh1
So one of the strongest pros of this game besides the unbelievably well written characters is how much you can do outside the box The game doesnt force you to play by the usual rules you can get really creative in and out of combat The game literally lets you cheese to your hearts content or do things even the game didnt expect you to do but youre able to With how the game is designed any object can be used in numerous ways you can do so many challenge runs with what you have at your disposal and I keep seeing people on other sites and Youtube show off just how insane you can get when playing this game Seriously you can almost do anything you want if you know what youre doing The game even allows you to skip important stuff and doesnt outright punish you sure it may come with consequences or unexpected cons but the game really does let you roam and do whatever in almost any order you wish The world is yours to roam Act to Act

h1uModsuh1
Larian Studios didnt just give us the best game I had played in awhile but they are fully supportive of mods This is a MAJOR deal because now the lifespan has increased by 10 years Like Skyrim they have an official built in modding system to let you download pretty much whatever you want and sites letting you apply whatever kind of mod youre seeking Larian Studios even made an animation showcasing how wacky and fun you can get with mods thats just awesome Surprisingly most if not every mod I had obtained works perfectly fine with little to no issues fully functional Again I cant stress enough how mods for this game is really doing it favors and with Larian Studios supporting all mods this will make the game 200 better in the long run

h1uFlawsuh1
So it seemed like I had nothing but praise for the game But there are some flaws with it and I wont be shy as to what these flaws are If you really love something you should be allowed to give critics

The biggest issue I have with this game is how the companions AI acts when they follow you They tend to get stuck often and you have to manually move them to catch up Worse if you come across traps or dangerous areas your companions do not have any intelligence to avoid their demise Sure the spacebar immediately stops them in their tracks but that only helps so much until it really becomes a problem

I remember in Tactical Mode I had my party stop onto an elevator waited 5 seconds because I wanted to make sure theyd stop moving then suddenly when the elevator moved all my party fell to their deaths clipping from the bottom Many traps or shifting parts due to bugs which speaking of

Another major issue is how glitchy buggy and unstable Act 3 is entirely The first two Acts were solid hardly any problems but Act 3 is riddled with pugs Clipping through the floor some cutscenes have missing NPCs dialogue has no sound and sometimes my companions are just dead after a cutscene for no reason 

h1uHonour Modeuh1
So this one is my absolute pet peeve While the other issues were worse for general gameplay this mode is just horrible While I did like the challenge and Legendary Actions that bosses had what makes it really difficult to enjoy was the fact you only get 1 save file thats it I understand why they did this and you must live with your consequences and dealing with your battles but the fact this game has some issues and especially Act 3 being so buggy it ruins a lot of runs in Honour Mode

I ended up having to make backup saves on my computer just to bypass the unfair situations I dont mind dying and losing legit but when its outside my control and the game ends my run cause of a bug glitch or unexpected error thats when I decide enough is enough

h1uConclusionuh1
Baldurs Gate 3 is when you decide to not just make a game Its a story brought to life that you can replay and never get tired of A game that will leave you remembering it for years to come 95  10",0.884518265724182129,136,True,Early Access,1739383360

The whole game itself doesnt hold your hand during the game but it does help you build up your skills and learn how to play as you go which is great for those who havent played CRPG turn based game before I have basically played this nonstop since October to pass time and as you can see with my 527 hours on record I absolutely LOVE this game The options for responses and endings are endless Im thoroughly blown away with the voice acting and yes the mod options There are many people who hate playing with mods but to me it adds a lot to the game and enhances my game play experience making me want to play it more I have done numerous campaigns and as of January 2025 Im doing my 2nd durge campaign trying to play a somewhat evil character which is hard as Ive cried from being evil to pixels haha

Unfortunately Im playing on a pretty old rig with an HDD yeah i know how it sounds thats seen better days The FPS hovers around 3040 sometimes dropping even lower At the start of each session the game struggles to load textures and Ive seen walls and characters pop into existence right before my eyes However the turn based combat system makes these technical hiccups more bearable though I wont lie they do take away a bit of the experience 

And the game itself Its a blast The characters are so diverse that it sometimes feels like watching live theater I ended up picking Karlach as a closer companion shes such a chaotic powerhouse but with a heart of gold and I cant help but love her energy Then theres Astarion whos a total jerk but absolutely hilarious one The guy almost stabbed me in the back when we first met but now it feels like every conversation with him could end in a sex scene Each one has a backstory a unique appearance and facial expressions that bring dialogues to life The story pulls you in like a swamp the music perfectly sets the mood and every corner of the map shows just how much heart the devs poured into this game 

Even though my old PC occasionally kills the vibe having my friend there to guide me lets me fully enjoy everything the game has to offer Also I went allin on the character creator instead of playing a premade origin The customization options are crazy detailed I spent way too much time tweaking my character but it was worth it to have someone that really felt like my own part of the story Honestly its one of the best RPG experiences Ive had

I still cannot wrap my head around how complex and interwoven the storyline is and how it changes with your choices Some critics may say the changes are not super significant Well maybe not on the surface but countless times my decisions in the past have echoed their way to the present and I can be damned or blessed by my actions But it doesnt stop the game from progressing It is a wild thing to try to describe Sometimes you get a gut punch from life and you really realize how important your friends and family are That is this game I have not played a game that has felt this human ever before

   In no other single player game in recent history have I invested so many hours into Started playing it during Early Access however not on Steam and due to it have another 125 hours not accounted for here Usually no matter how much I enjoy the game I just play games once exceptions are games which require multiple playthroughs and playing anything more than that just gets really tedious and a chore to me This game managed to bypass that I am doing several separate playthroughs and having so much fun in every single one because of the sheer amount of varied content it contains as well as all the ways combat can be resolved you could say only your imagination is the limit There is just so much to experience

   I have not played first two Baldurs Gate games what I had played was Larians Divinity Original Sin 2 which saying I enjoyed it is an understatement still can not get some of the music there out of my head and I might slightly prefer it over music in this game however incredible it is and is a main reason why I started the third part I was not at all disappointed Game more than delivered and largely expanded on almost everything good DOS 2 did
You can enjoy this game without having any prior experience with the series There are characters appearing from previous entries some even can be your companions There is some mention of events that transpired so having prior knowledge is a bonus but its nothing major and you will not have missed much otherwise

   First time I started the game I just spent a few hours in the character creator partly due to trying to create a perfect character partly deciding which class to pick and how I wanted to play and partly just listening to its amazing music In all this time I still did not get to experience every class subclass and content hidden behind them Not only do classes provide different experience concerning combat they also give you special prompts in dialog same as races so for example sorcerer might be all I am magic incarnate and you measly creatures cannot contain me while also taking every opportunity to tease wizards as a paladin people might ask you to judge criminals as a bard you can just take a break from adventuring pick your stage and perform music you can pick it as a feat for other non bard classes but it will take a while nearby characters will come nearby and listen to you and even give you gold it is one of the ways to make gold however excruciatingly slow one if your really wanted to you could make your whole party being proficient with instruments and create a band and you can actually hear all the different instruments used by them

   There is so many routes you can take your character on On one hand you can be a hero trying to protect innocents fighting evil preventing bad guys from their goals helping everyone as much as possible not wanting to do anything with mind flayers while on the other you can be the polar opposite you can be like the ultimate evil one you can betray steal kill and do things that will leave even the games evil characters dumbfounded You can also be anything in between Game is written so well that no matter the path you take it is fully fledged and makes sense In most games doing evil things and picking evil choices is just you being rude towards other people and feels really bad picking them here there is a certain excitement to them they are more complex and it is like you are experiencing another layer of the game you were not even aware of 
I think Dark Urge is the best way to play the game if you are mostly interested in the story of the game resisting it or not there is so much content connected to it you otherwise miss about the story and so many little bits and pieces that suddenly make sense

   Game is consisting of three chapters Each chapter has multiple zones connected to it with a plethora of content They are all closely interwoven meaning that saying something while in a dialog to character in chapter one will have consequences with that character in chapter three Saving someone in chapter one may just see that character in chapter two willing to help you with something you have a need for or you might just find that character in the last chapter while exploring houses or suppose you did not save them in chapter one or even killed them you may just find their relatives in the last chapter wondering what happened to them Or some of them might help you and make things easier for you You might just get quests and items you otherwise would not but you might also miss alternate routes There is so much content it is impossible to see everything in just one playthrough or even several

   Saying that first and second chapter are as close to perfection as they come while i feel like the last third chapter of the game is the weakest point of this game Compared to first two it just feels like it missing something even though it is filled with content there is a certain emptiness to it It just feels like it needed a bit more time for example there is ton of npcs and you can speak with most however you will just get their one line and that will be the end of it I understand not every npc could get a full on life story and dialog but I never felt like this with them in earlier chapters they are just missing something
That said chapter also has many positives I particularly like how you get a base camp in a rough part of the city but if you want to pay you can get yourself a whole floor in a tavern and use that as a camp instead You can rob a bank help a necromancer or not meet zombies and help them instead shapeshifters vampires obscene cults even print your own version of towns newspapers with you in it and read them the next day

181763787,76561198063900528,User,10,8107,Recommended,"Baldurs Gate 3 quickly became one of my favourite games and is one of the best ones I ever played 

   In no other single player game in recent history have I invested so many hours into Started playing it during Early Access however not on Steam and due to it have another 125 hours not accounted for here Usually no matter how much I enjoy the game I just play games once exceptions are games which require multiple playthroughs and playing anything more than that just gets really tedious and a chore to me This game managed to bypass that I am doing several separate playthroughs and having so much fun in every single one because of the sheer amount of varied content it contains as well as all the ways combat can be resolved you could say only your imagination is the limit There is just so much to experience

   I have not played first two Baldurs Gate games what I had played was Larians Divinity Original Sin 2 which saying I enjoyed it is an understatement still can not get some of the music there out of my head and I might slightly prefer it over music in this game however incredible it is and is a main reason why I started the third part I was not at all disappointed Game more than delivered and largely expanded on almost everything good DOS 2 did
You can enjoy this game without having any prior experience with the series There are characters appearing from previous entries some even can be your companions There is some mention of events that transpired so having prior knowledge is a bonus but its nothing major and you will not have missed much otherwise

   First time I started the game I just spent a few hours in the character creator partly due to trying to create a perfect character partly deciding which class to pick and how I wanted to play and partly just listening to its amazing music In all this time I still did not get to experience every class subclass and content hidden behind them Not only do classes provide different experience concerning combat they also give you special prompts in dialog same as races so for example sorcerer might be all I am magic incarnate and you measly creatures cannot contain me while also taking every opportunity to tease wizards as a paladin people might ask you to judge criminals as a bard you can just take a break from adventuring pick your stage and perform music you can pick it as a feat for other non bard classes but it will take a while nearby characters will come nearby and listen to you and even give you gold it is one of the ways to make gold however excruciatingly slow one if your really wanted to you could make your whole party being proficient with instruments and create a band and you can actually hear all the different instruments used by them

   There is so many routes you can take your character on On one hand you can be a hero trying to protect innocents fighting evil preventing bad guys from their goals helping everyone as much as possible not wanting to do anything with mind flayers while on the other you can be the polar opposite you can be like the ultimate evil one you can betray steal kill and do things that will leave even the games evil characters dumbfounded You can also be anything in between Game is written so well that no matter the path you take it is fully fledged and makes sense In most games doing evil things and picking evil choices is just you being rude towards other people and feels really bad picking them here there is a certain excitement to them they are more complex and it is like you are experiencing another layer of the game you were not even aware of

The plethora of character customizations combined with vast class options makes for the ultimate way to experience DD as a game with simpler and easier rules to follow The worldbuilding character development and consequences of your smallest choices or failed rolls dialogue checks lead to endless replayability and one of the most immersive experiences in gaming history The combat requires patience at times but the freedom and robustness of its systems more than make up for being turnbased once youve adjusted You can do anything from turning the battlefield into flooded fields bouncing with bolts of lightning to using the enemies themselves as weapons

With no prior experience playing Dungeons  Dragons and not being a fan of turnbased combat I struggled to connect with the game The mechanics felt foreign and I found myself drifting away to play other titles

But something about Baldurs Gate 3 kept pulling me back I gave it another shot and then it clicked 
I started to enjoy the combat figuring out how to use the environment to my advantage and I realized just how much influence you can wield outside of battle Conversations choices and strategies became just as important as swinging a sword or casting a spell

I became invested in the characters more than I have in any other game Well most of them  I dont like Wyll His story just felt underwhelming compared to the others Each companion had depth and complexity that kept me hooked The freedom the game offers is truly unparalleled I could shape my own story in ways that felt meaningful I found myself losing track of time wanting to know what would happen next

Fast forward 150 hours and Ive just finished my first playthrough Without a doubt this is the best game Ive ever played and Ive played a LOT of games The sense of emptiness it leaves behind is almost painful All I want to do is dive back in and start a new run Taking suggestions on what character or class to try next

167551362,76561198009723453,Curator,61,2031,Not Recommended,"To be brief its Divinity with worse gameplay and better polish The nebulous term Gameplay is going to be the focus of this review because my opinion is firmly stuck on that being the most important part of a game arbitrarily or otherwise Skip the review if you dont care

Most D20 systems by their very design are incredibly random and this is fine in a tabletop environment with friends where youre all going on this journey together and the hand dealt isnt always optimal but you have fun learning about things in the process  Plus it has a DM that can fudge the rolls from time to time from behind the screen so that players doing impressive and cool things can be rewarded by just pretending that they nat 20d or something This for me does not work in a preset unchanging environment like the one found in this game

This isnt a problem with RNG as a whole just the breadth of it within BG3s design which Id assume is a problem that arose from trying to graft the DD ruleset exactly how it is onto a videogame without making enough concessions for the adaptation process Different games handle this in different ways Disco Elysium uses a 2d6 system so that your roll bonuses are more impactful even early on due to the smaller window of possible results whilst also including a bunch of situational bonuses depending on prior decisions Fallout NV removes RNG entirely by just allowing you to talk about the things that your skills say you have the knowhow to talk about DDs Everyone can succeed and everyone can fail mentality is suitable for the tabletop  but since the other characters wont really have many interactions with your bad rolls the story cant change too drastically because of them and the DM cant make silly things happen in response the one true difference between this and the tabletop begins to shine through Reloading

Outside of Ironman modes all of these games allow you to just fail a check and then reload to roll it again which begs the question why any of these games even bother to have dice rolls at all except to waste your time reloading when the coin flip fails or more likely to better simulate the tabletop game experience for its own sake

Your choices only matter when you want them to matter so you might as well install a mod that bypasses every single roll in dialogue and youd have the exact same experience just much quicker There is nothing enjoyable in the failures in dialogue theres no Harry to leap through the air flipping the double bird only to crash into a disabled NPC theres no silliness added in  Its all very classy its all played surprisingly safe despite how horny it is Granted this isnt what fully kills the game for me Im not averse to CYOA books after all

The issues of gameplay are much more prevalent in the combat which suffers the same weird RNG problems as the dialogue with the same savescumming possibilities and somehow fewer options DDs combat system especially 5Es is so simple that anyone can pick it up and play it at a table with nothing but some dice and some scraps of paper This is great for the tabletop where nothing is automated and it works fine in the game  Its just so unbearably dull for me

There are so many different variables in play about the shape of the map and where you can stand good vantage points for ranged attacks or chokepoints to prevent approaches theres different status ailments and a dizzying array of damage types weird surface conditions and even the light level  But in the three attempts I had of this game all on different difficulties none of that really mattered Sure itd be cool in the tabletop to stealthily shoot out a lit candle so your opponents cant see you as well and have a nice narrative moment where your allies can quip even if you bollocks it up in BG3 theres no real need to do anything other than march full speed into your enemies faces and spam whatever abilities you like best until the rolls have determined that youve won and then immediately long rest

The games difficulty and complexity are rendered moot by the wealth of perfectly viable options the presence of more viable options at all is rendered moot by the wildness of a D20 and any differences between the viability of those options is rendered moot by the ability to reload a save and succeed no matter what Tactician modes combat difficulty had two speeds Standard and nearly impossible without savescumming brought on entirely by when in your progress you choose to approach an encounter It added in JRPG grindingforbeefgates into this DD game without any direct indication For the record Im cool with JRPG grinding its just strange to see it here in a game that isnt conducive to it Tactician doesnt make the game more Tactical as the most effective strategy I can think of off the top of my head is to have 4 Warlocks using max range Eldritch Blast on everyone and just praying that the hit and damage dice both roll high If they dont roll high reload You werent going to win anyway The game never requires you to interact with all this stuff that effort went into making is what Im getting at here 

Combat feels like a weirdly easy slog and despite all of the different abilities and classes none of them really feel all that different to one another The key differences seem to be what your effective range is whether or not you can heal and how many times you can attack in a single turn or between rests everything else ends up just being variations of the same gameplay loop for every character Maybe at Level 20 theres some secret sauce Im missing but the game can just not hold my attention long enough with its FisherPrice mechanics to have me journey beyond Act 2

Its hard to describe exactly why its like this
Maybe its the hard action limit per turn
So many buffs and alterations are full actions when they feel like they should be bonus actions It might be the AP system alone that prevents me from having the same gripes with Divinity 2 

Maybe its the lack of impact or indication that all of these different damage types are actually doing something outside of Well that enemy looks like its a bit on fire so I wont use fire on it  Divinity 2s exploding poison puddles were always good for a laugh

The real problem is likely not with the game but with me and people like me who have bothered to read all this way into the review who just want games to be more engaging than they are perhaps meant to be

I almost want to say I dont know who this game is for which is bizarre and hilarious since its such a popular and wellreceived game It appears to be for everybody Its narrative has gore violence dark themes sex even genitalia on the character creation screen but then once the nittygritty of the gameplay rears its ugly head it turns into Snakes  Ladders Its like the opposite of a mascot platformer

If you enjoy it more power to you I kind of envy that I genuinely wish I could just overlook the games boring combat to enjoy the parts about it that are actually pretty decent  My last attempt was even on the easiest difficulty so that I could just blitz through it as fast as possible but it was still too much of a bugbear to get over

tldr
Gameplay over all You can still have the other things too just do good gameplay first pls If you agree with that skip this game

This review implies I know what good gameplay is obviously Lol

The one positive thing I can share that isnt immediately obviously present in the blue reviews is that Im glad that what is essentially ERPing with someones OCs is not only more widely accepted now but one of this games key selling points

Game play and game mechanics are similar to Dungeons  Dragons There are nice tieins to the series that DD players including myself will appreciate such as certain races like elves and halfelves having dark vision critical successes and critical failures and classes like bards wizards and fighters One key difference between the game and DD is that in Baldurs Gate 3 instead of rolling initiative at the start of each turn initiative is rolled only once and remains locked in for the rest of combat Its not a feature but the most authentic part to DD are perception checks Just like DD your characters will fail almost all of their perception checks This is true even if they have high wisdom which affects perception and even if the switch or button or trap is an inch from their face Knowledge of DD isnt required to play though as there are tutorials for your first play through and game play is intuitive One caveat is that the early game is slow and not especially exciting Your party will fold over like lawn chairs from levels 13 especially the mages Things get more interesting at level 5 onward Thats when mages unlock powerful AOE spells and most classes gain second attacks

Where the game really shines is all of its content There are so many classes paladin barbarian fighter druid cleric bard and monk and just as many races too Many classes and races also have subclasses or subraces which allows indepth customization of your characters The only problem with this is customizing your first character assuming you dont choose a premade one can take a very long time especially if youre indecisive like me My first character Daelis was a Wild Magic Sorcerer and I had a cleric fighter and rogue in my party Each class felt distinct and was fun in their own way

The story was very enjoyable no spoilers here You are forced to make many tough irreversible decisions with farreaching consequences throughout this did raise my blood pressure at times but it also made everything feel more consequential I liked how my party members backstories diverged and intersected with the main story Each character was wellwritten and fullyfleshed out which made it feel like a real DD campaign There isnt much replayability when it comes to the main story You can make different decisions which can affect the ending but the overall story line remains the same Unlike DD there is only one campaign Things that surprised you in your first play through will be expected in the second Replayability is instead found in game play and quests Its impossible to complete every quest especially every party members unique quests in one play through All the different races and classes also give the game more replay value You can also recruit different party members than last time resulting in new character interactions

My only complaint is saving in the game There is an autosave system but it only activates after you enter important areas Youre forced to manually quicksave most of the time I eventually got the hang of it but it was annoying at first when I forgot to quicksave and lost progress I played on the Balanced difficulty which is essentially normal and struggled during many fights I had to reload old saves because my party kept dying or failing Thats more of a skill issue on my party than a problem with the game though If you play a lot of casual games and dont have experience with RPGs Id recommend the Narrative or easy mode Things will still be challenging its just your blood pressure wont spike as much

163181207,76561199033142651,Curator,32,5151,Recommended,"Baldurs Gate 3 is a generational masterpiece far surpassing any other RPG to come before it It wasnt just 2023s game of the year it was one of the best AAA releases of the previous 10 years Graphically mesmerizing every single inch of the experience oozing with creativity and passion

The sheer amount of replayability coop fun endless builds and fun combat makes it simply an incredible release a rare sight given the current AAA gaming landscape Well optimized forgiving fun Not a single MTX in sight

Your actions truly matter in this game Your decisions will affect the outcome of every single playthrough which means every single run will be different every time you play You can talk to your friends about the game and theyll be confused at the outcomes you personally had in your campaign since they took different decisions Some brutal while others minor it never stops feeling like a genuine adventure

bThis game is amazingb The story is for the most part true to the lore and wellwritten I loved seeing the story unfold as I made my choices and thinking to myself yeah that totally makes sense within the story They used the existing lore of the Sword Coast as a basis for most of this story and did a very good job of it Sure its not perfectly faithful to 100 of the lore  there are some clear exceptions if players are seasoned DnD fans  but these differences are mostly made in favour of playability The game has so many Easter eggs for players like me but at the same time its very friendly to people who are brandnew to DnD and dont know any of the lore

One thing I really appreciate about this game in general is that they made sure that our choices as players matter and haave real consequences in the story something that is so easy for games like this to miss Giving real consequences to choices means more branches in the story and I appreciate that the developers actually considered so many different paths that our actions could take us

The combat mechanics are great Combat could have easily been a makeorbreak aspect of translating tabletop into video game but they actually made combat fun I like that they modified certain spells and abilities to make the game more videogamefriendly and they nailed it IMO 

The characters are very well written and wellintegrated into the overarching story Most have interesting backstories and entertaining personalities that develop and change over time in their own way Each character arc is satisfying in its own way and there are many heartwrenching moments in their progression with and without romancing them There is a good balance of humor that can help liven up otherwise heavy moments especially with certain characters The voice acting and motion capture work is fantastic  its genuinely impressive how theyve managed to convey such deep and real emotions with their voice and facial expressions

This game feels and plays like a love letter to tabletop DnD in every way I have played it for several hundred hours and will play several more since there are so many different paths to walk and endings to reach I would give anything to play to again for the first time I hope everyone at Larian studios  the writers staff animators voice actors artists and beyond  know what a masterpiece theyve made They deserve every award theyve received",0.545454561710357666,2,False,Recent,1742835415

For those who never played or liked a game with turnbased combat or having to move based choosing positions to take I recommend using the controller The Freemovement made me forget it was that kind of game
