# Data Projects Repository

Welcome to the Data Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of data science projects that I have worked on, covering various aspects of data scraping, analysis, visualization, machine learning, and SQL.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Data Scraping**: This directory contains projects related to API and web scraping. Here, you'll find scripts and tools used to extract data from various online sources.

- **Data Analysis (EDA)**: This section includes exploratory data analysis projects. These projects focus on understanding data distributions, identifying patterns, and generating insights through visualizations and statistical analysis.

- **Dashboards**: In this directory, you'll find interactive dashboards created to visualize data and present insights in a user-friendly manner. These dashboards are built using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Plotly Dash.

- **Machine Learning**: This directory contains machine learning projects, including model development, training, and evaluation. Projects here cover a range of algorithms and techniques applied to different datasets.

- **SQL**: This section includes SQL scripts and projects focused on database querying and manipulation. You'll find examples of data extraction, transformation, and analysis using SQL.

## Getting Started
